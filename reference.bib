	abstract={Study Design Randomized clinical study. Introduction Supervised physical therapy (PT) and home exercise programs (HEPs) are frequently used in the rehabilitation of patients with distal radius fracture (DRF). However, there is no consensus as to whether unsupervised HEP provides comparable benefits to those achieved by supervised PT. Purpose of the Study To compare the improvements in pain and functional status between a supervised PT program and unsupervised HEP in DRF patients older than 60 years. Methods A total of 74 patients were randomized into 2 groups. One group received 12 sessions of supervised PT (n= 37), and the other group followed an exercise program at home (n= 37). Three evaluations were performed, before the initiation of treatment, at 6-week, and 6-month follow-up. The study conducted a statistical power analysis to detect an intergroup difference score of 15 points on the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE). Thet-test or Mann-Whitney test was used, and it was set with a significance level of .05. Results The supervised PT group showed clinically significant differences in the total PRWE score at 6 weeks (17.67 points,P= .000) in the PRWE function score (15.2 points,P= .000) and in the PRWE pain score (5.6 points,P= .039). There was also a significant difference in the total PRWE score at 6-month follow-up (17.05 points,P= .000) in the PRWE function score (14.5 points,P= .000) and in the PRWE pain score (2.5 points,P= .35). Conclusions A supervised PT program is more effective for improving function in the short- and medium-term when compared with HEP in patients older than 60 years with DRF extraarticular without immediate complications.

abstract = {This retrospective study investigated the validity of hand-grip dynamometry with respect to its use in predicting generalized upper extremity strength. The records of 37 patients (mean average age, 77.7 years) receiving home care were used. Discriminant construct validity was examined by comparing their dynamometry measurements with measurements of age- and gender-matched healthy individuals reported in the literature. Convergent construct validity was described by the correlations of their dynamometry measurements and manual muscle test scores of the upper extremities. The patients' dynamometer-measured grip forces were significantly less than reported normative values. The patients' dynamometer measured grip forces were correlated significantly with their manual muscle test scores. These findings support the construct validity of hand-grip dynamometry for characterizing upper extremity strength impairment among adults treated in a home care setting.},

abstract = {After surgery for trauma or correction of congenital anomaly, hand function is difficult to evaluate in children because there are no reference norms on children 3 to 5 years old. The purpose of this study was to determine whether reproducible normative values for hand dexterity and grip and pinch strength could be obtained in young children using simple tests that could be administered quickly within the attention span of a 3- to 5-year-old. The Functional Dexterity Test (FDT), a pegboard test validated for adults and older children, seemed to meet our requirements for dexterity. The FDT was administered to a convenience sample of normal children in a prekindergarten school who were grouped according to age: 3-year-olds (n = 17), 4-year-olds (n = 24), and 5-year-olds (n = 22). Hand dominance was determined. The task was demonstrated by 1 of the 2 testers. The child was asked to turn the pegs over in the pegboard without using the free hand or balancing the peg against the chest. Both hands were tested. Grip and pinch strengths were measured in both hands in a consistent manner. All the children were tested with the arm at the side and the elbow at 90 degrees. A dynamometer was used for grip strength and a pinch meter was used to measure key (lateral) and tripod pinch strengths. Means and SDs were calculated for each age group, and the dependent values of dexterity, strength, and dominance were correlated. Dexterity and strength scores were significantly different by age group. A good FDT score in the dominant hand was predictive of a good score in the nondominant hand. Grip and pinch strength correlated poorly with functional dexterity. The normative values established in this study for children in the 3- to 5-year-old range can be referenced for disability estimates and establishing goals for children after surgery or hand injury.},

abstract = {Objective: To present the normative hand grip strength values measured with a bulb dynamometer for children, by gender and age, and to correlate the findings with weight, height, body composition and handedness. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Data from 295 healthy children of both genders aged 6 to 13 years were analysed. Methods: Weight, height, body composition (Biodynamics model 450 bioimpedance analyser), handedness (Edinburgh scale) and grip strength measured with a bulb dynamometer (North Coast) were obtained. Results: Grip strength of both hands increased with age in the two genders. Grip strength was similar in boys and girls between 6 and 13 years of age. The dominant hand was stronger than the non-dominant hand [mean (standard deviation) 7.0 (2.3) psi vs 6.5 (2.1) psi], with a mean difference of 0.52 psi (95\% confidence interval of the difference 0.46 to 0.58). Grip strength was positively correlated with fat-free mass and height (r ≥ 0.75). Conclusion: This study provides normative values for hand grip strength measured with a bulb dynamometer in children aged 6 to 13 years. This dynamometer provides a simple method to measure grip strength, and the results of this study provide further evidence of its performance in the measurement of grip strength. © 2014 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.},

Participants (n = 1,446, 32\% female) were born near Hyderabad, India, in 29 villages from 1987 to 1990, during which time only intervention villages (n = 15) had a government program that offered balanced protein-calorie supplementation to pregnant women and children. Participants' LBM and appendicular skeletal muscle mass were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; grip strength and information on lifestyle indicators, including diet and physical activity level, were also obtained. Ages (mean = 20.3 years) and body mass indexes (weight (kg)/height (m)(2); mean = 19.5) of participants in 2 groups were similar. Current dietary energy intake was higher in the intervention group. Unadjusted LBM and grip strength were similar in 2 groups. After adjustment for potential confounders, the intervention group had lower LBM ($\beta$ = -0.75; P = 0.03), appendicular skeletal muscle mass, and grip strength than did controls, but these differences were small in magnitude (<0.1 standard deviation). Multivariable regression analyses showed that current socioeconomic position, energy intake, and physical activity level had a positive association with adult LBM and muscle strength. This study could not detect a "programming" effect of early nutrition supplementation on adult LBM and muscle strength.},

From 2007 to 2009, BMD (g/cm(2) ) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. At the same time, physical performance was measured using five tests: grip strength, leg extension power, walking speed, narrow-walk pace, and chair stands. Cognitive performance was assessed using the modified Mini-Mental State Examination and the Trail-Making Test Part B. Participants were categorized into quartiles of BPb. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent relationship between BPb, BMD, and cognitive and physical function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mean BPb ± standard deviation was 2.25 ± 1.20 $\mu$g/dL (median 2 $\mu$g/dL, range 1-10 $\mu$g/dL). In multivariate-adjusted models, men in higher BPb quartiles had lower BMD at femoral neck and total hip (P-trend < .001 for both). Men with higher BPb had lower age-adjusted score for grip strength (P-trend < .001), although this association was not significant in multivariate-adjusted models (P-trend < .15). BPb was not associated with lumbar spine BMD, cognition, leg extension power, walking speed, narrow-walk pace, or chair stands.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Environmental lead exposure may adversely affect bone health in older men. These findings support consideration of environmental exposure in age-associated bone fragility.},

abstract = {Background \& aims: Hand grip strength (HGS) has been found to respond to nutrition deprivation and repletion but few studies have investigated its use as an independent nutrition assessment tool. We conducted an observational study to determine if HGS can predict nutrition status independently of other factors. Methods: The Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used to determine nutrition status. PG-SGA and HGS measures were collected from 217 well nourished and malnourished hospital patients for cross-sectional analysis. Of the 217, 18 patients had these assessments repeated two weeks (±3 days) later to assess change. Correlation, and multiple linear and binary regression analyses were conducted. Results: HGS and PG-SGA score were significantly correlated (r=0.292, P<0.01). HGS was a significant independent predictor of PG-SGA score and category (P<0.01), accounting for 4\% and 9\% of variability respectively. Change-in-HGS was an independent predictor of change-in-PG-SGA score (P=0.04) and category (P=0.06) over two weeks, accounting for 47\% and 42\% of variability respectively. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HGS can independently predict nutrition status and change in nutrition status defined by PG-SGA score and category, although future longer term research is required to confirm the use of HGS as an early detection tool for malnutrition risk. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract = {Background and aims: Several studies have reported that regular consumption of breakfast is associated with health benefits. However, only a few studies have examined the association between frequency of breakfast consumption and muscular function. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between frequency of breakfast consumption and muscle strength among apparently healthy Japanese adults. Methods and results: A cross-sectional study design was used. Between 2008 and 2011 in Sendai, Japan, 1415 Japanese adult employees (1069 men and 346 women) aged between 19 and 83 years participated in the study. Grip strength, as measured by a handheld digital dynamometer, was used as an indicator of muscle strength. Frequency of breakfast consumption during the previous month was assessed using a brief self-administered dietary history questionnaire, and the results were divided into three categories for analysis: low (≤2daysweek-1), middle (3-5daysweek-1) and high (≥6daysweek-1). Multivariate analysis was performed using analysis of covariance, with covariates mainly including socio-demographic, lifestyle-related and health-related factors. After adjusting for several potential confounders, grip strength was shown to be positively associated with breakfast consumption frequency (geometric means, 95\% confidence interval (CI): low frequency, 36.2 (35.7-36.8) kg; middle frequency, 36.7 (36.0-37.5) kg; high frequency, 37.0 (36.6-37.5) kg; P for trend=0.03). Grip strength per kilogramme body weight (kgkg-1) was also positively associated with frequency of breakfast consumption (P for trend=0.01). Conclusions: This cross-sectional study reveals a positive association between breakfast consumption frequency and muscle strength in apparently healthy adults. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Paclet2014,
abstract = {This study was motivated by the double action of extrinsic hand muscles that produce grip force and also contribute to wrist torque. We explored interactions between grip force and wrist torque in isometric force production tasks. In particular, we tested a hypothesis that an intentional change in one of the two kinetic variables would produce an unintentional change in the other (enslaving). When young healthy subjects produced accurate changes in the grip force, only minor effects on the force produced by the hand (by wrist flexion/extension action) were observed. In contrast, a change in the hand force produced consistent changes in grip force in the same direction. The magnitude of such unintentional grip force change was stronger for intentional hand force decrease as compared to hand force increase. These effects increased with the magnitude of the initial grip force. When the subjects were asked to produce accurate total force computed as the sum of the hand and grip forces, strong negative covariation between the two forces was seen across trials interpreted as a synergy stabilizing the total force. An index of this synergy was higher in the space of "modes," hypothetical signals to the two effectors that could be changed by the controller one at a time. We interpret the complex enslaving effects (positive force covariation) as conditioned by typical everyday tasks. The presence of synergic effects (negative, task-specific force covariation) can be naturally interpreted within the referent configuration hypothesis.},

This analysis, conducted as part of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project, sought to identify cutpoints that distinguish weakness associated with mobility impairment, defined as gait speed less than 0.8 m/s.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In pooled cross-sectional data (9,897 men and 10,950 women), Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to derive cutpoints for grip strength associated with mobility impairment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In men, a grip strength of 26-32 kg was classified as "intermediate" and less than 26 kg as "weak"; 11\% of men were intermediate and 5\% were weak. Compared with men with normal strength, odds ratios for mobility impairment were 3.63 (95\% CI: 3.01-4.38) and 7.62 (95\% CI 6.13-9.49), respectively. In women, a grip strength of 16-20 kg was classified as "intermediate" and less than 16 kg as "weak"; 25\% of women were intermediate and 18\% were weak. Compared with women with normal strength, odds ratios for mobility impairment were 2.44 (95\% CI 2.20-2.71) and 4.42 (95\% CI 3.94-4.97), respectively. Weakness based on these cutpoints was associated with mobility impairment across subgroups based on age, body mass index, height, and disease status. Notably, in women, grip strength divided by body mass index provided better fit relative to grip strength alone, but fit was not sufficiently improved to merit different measures by gender and use of a more complex measure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Cutpoints for weakness derived from this large, diverse sample of older adults may be useful to identify populations who may benefit from interventions to improve muscle strength and function.},

Their strength during gripping performance is described in detail, and following the indices were calculated: maximum strength (MS), response time (RT), time to MS, time to reach turning point (TP), strength at TP, inclination from start to TP, time from TP to reach MS, inclination from TP to MS and ratio of strength (TP/MS). Barthel Index (BI), total scores and scores of each subclass were used for evaluating activities of daily living independence. MS was compared between the independent and dependent groups. Correlations, using partial Pearson's coefficient adjusted for age, and Mini-Mental State Examination total score were analyzed between indices and BI by sex, side, and age groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: MS was significantly higher in the independent group. MS and RT were significantly related with BI total and certain subclasses in both hands, TP/MS was significantly related in the right hand of either sex, and strength at TP was significantly related in both hands in women and in the left hand in men. Time to reach TP was particularly correlated in both hands and time from TP to reach MS in the right hand, in men.

abstract = {This study was aimed at investigating the relation between grip strength and anthropometric factors and the impact of an aerobic exercise on grip strength in young men with Down syndrome (DS). This study was a pre-post design. Twelve males with DS were assigned to an exercise group, who walked using an incremental protocol on a treadmill for 20. min at aerobic levels. Eight additional persons with DS were assigned to an attentional control group, who watched a video. Measure of grip strength was tested pre- and post-interventions. The results showed positively significant relationship among grip strength and age (r= .74, p< .01), weight (r= .52, p= .02), body mass index (r= .61, p= .01) and waist circumference (r= .54, p= .02). In addition, Grip strength was slightly improved after exercise (p= .03) but decreased after control condition. The results showed that anthropometric factors, such as age, weight, body mass index and waist circumference, were positively correlated with grip strength in young men with DS. Further, improvement in grip strength can be found even after a single exercise session. This finding emphasizes the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle in persons with DS for performing activities of daily living. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Use and non-use of body parts during goal-directed action are major forces driving reorganisation of neural processing. We investigated changes in functional brain activity resulting from acute short-term immobilisation of the dominant right hand. Informed by the concept of object affordances, we predicted that the presence or absence of a limb restraint would influence the perception of graspable objects in a laterally specific way.Twenty-three participants underwent fMRI scanning during a passive object-viewing task before the intervention as well as with and without wearing an orthosis. The right dorsal premotor cortex and the left cerebellum were more strongly activated when the handle of an object was oriented towards the left hand while the right hand was immobilised compared with a situation where the hand was not immobilised. The cluster in the premotor cortex showing an interaction between condition (with restraint, without restraint) and stimulus action side (right vs. left) overlapped with the general task vs. baseline contrast prior to the intervention, confirming its functional significance for the task.These results show that acute immobilisation of the dominant right hand leads to rapid changes of the perceived affordance of objects. We conclude that changes in action requirements lead to almost instantaneous changes in functional activation patterns, which in turn may trigger structural cortical plasticity. © 2014.},

abstract = {Background: Body fat changes in HIV-infected persons are associated with increased systemic inflammation and increased mortality. It is unknown whether lipodystrophy is also associated with declines in physical function. Methods: Between 2001 and 2003, 33 HIV-infected men with evidence of lipodystrophy (LIPO+), 23 HIV-infected men without lipodystrophy (LIPO -), and 33 seronegative men were recruited from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) for the Body Composition substudy. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was assessed by quantitative computed tomography. Lean body mass (LBM) and extremity fat were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was estimated by Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA). Serum IL-6, soluble TNF-$\alpha$ receptors I and II (sTNFRI and sTNFRII), and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations were quantified from archived serum samples. These measurements were correlated with grip strength measured in 2007 using linear regression. Results: At the substudy visit, the LIPO+ group had higher HOMA, sTNFRI , sTNFRII, IL-6 levels than the LIPO- group. In 2007, LIPO+ group had lower median grip strength than the LIPO- group (34.4 v 42.7 kg, p=0.002). Multivariable analysis of HIV+ men showed older age, lower LBM, higher sTNFRII concentrations, and LIPO+ status (adjusted mean difference -4.9 kg [p=0.045]) at the substudy visit were independently associated with lower subsequent grip strength. Conclusions: Inflammation, lower LBM, and lipodystrophy in HIV-infected men were associated with lower subsequent grip strength. These findings suggest that inflammation may contribute to declines in functional performance, independent of age.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: This case-control study was performed to evaluate 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] deficiency and its correlation with hand grip strength in 95 Indian hip fracture subjects and 95 controls. 25(OH)D deficiency was found in 88.4 \% of hip fracture subjects that was significantly higher as compared to controls. Hand grip strength as measured by hand held dynamometer was significantly lower in patients, and there was a significant positive correlation between 25(OH)D and hand grip strength.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: The present study was conducted to assess correlation between 25(OH) D and hand grip strength in hip fracture subjects residing in North India.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ninety-five patients with hip fracture and similar number of controls were enrolled in the study. Fasting venous samples were analyzed for 25(OH)D, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphate. Hand grip strength of study subjects was measured using Jamar dynamometer. Correlation between vitamin D levels and hand grip strength was analyzed in study population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean age of hip fracture subjects was 61.4 ± 12.6 years which was comparable in men and women. Out of 95 subjects, 57 were men and 38 were women. Mean 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower whereas intact PTH levels were significantly higher in patient group compared controls (10.29 ± 6.53 vs 13.6 ± 4.01 ng/ml; 62.6 ± 59.3 vs 37.7 ± 28.8 pg/ml, respectively). The number of subjects with 25(OH)D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism was significantly higher in hip fracture group. The mean hand grip strength among hip fracture subjects was significantly lower compared to that of controls (16.57 ± 5.74 vs 26.74 ± 5.23 kg). There was a significant positive correlation between 25(OH)D and hand grip strength ( r = 0.482, p value <0.01) in hip fracture population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Majority of hip fracture patients in India have vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and lower hand grip strength compared to controls. Further, there is significant positive correlation between 25(OH)D and hand grip strength.},

abstract = {The performance of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that continuously control upper limb neuroprostheses may benefit from distinguishing periods of posture and movement so as to prevent inappropriate movement of the prosthesis. Few studies, however, have investigated how decoding behavioral states and detecting the transitions between posture and movement could be used autonomously to trigger a kinematic decoder. We recorded simultaneous neuronal ensemble and local field potential (LFP) activity from microelectrode arrays in primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) premotor areas of two male rhesus monkeys performing a center-out reach-and-grasp task, while upper limb kinematics were tracked with a motion capture system with markers on the dorsal aspect of the forearm, hand, and fingers. A state decoder was trained to distinguish four behavioral states (baseline, reaction, movement, hold), while a kinematic decoder was trained to continuously decode hand end point position and 18 joint angles of the wrist and fingers. LFP amplitude most accurately predicted transition into the reaction (62\%) and movement (73\%) states, while spikes most accurately decoded arm, hand, and finger kinematics during movement. Using an LFP-based state decoder to trigger a spike-based kinematic decoder [r = 0.72, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.15] significantly improved decoding of reach-to-grasp movements from baseline to final hold, compared with either a spike-based state decoder combined with a spike-based kinematic decoder (r = 0.70, RMSE = 0.17) or a spike-based kinematic decoder alone (r = 0.67, RMSE = 0.17). Combining LFP-based state decoding with spike-based kinematic decoding may be a valuable step toward the realization of BMI control of a multifingered neuroprosthesis performing dexterous manipulation.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to characterize the coordination of grasp and twist in hand function of normal and post-stroke subjects using a two degree of freedom hand robot. Results of the analysis of data from eight control subjects indicated that normal grip coordination involves the linear modulation of grip force with load torque. Thus, there was a high correlation between grip force and load torque. Also, the force generated by the thumb was highly correlated with the force generated by the index, middle and ring fingers. Finally, the safety margin used to stabilize grasp and avoid slip was consistent across normal subjects. In contrast, results from chronic post-stroke subjects indicated that they generally: (1) exerted excessive grip force to stabilize grasp using their ipsilesional hand; (2) lost the close amplitude coupling between grip force and load torque; and (3) lost the close modulation of the thumb force with finger force. These results suggest that our methods may provide objective, quantitative means of characterizing coordination problems following stroke.},

abstract = {The aim was to study the association between bone microarchitecture and muscle mass and strength in older men. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone microarchitecture were assessed in 810 men aged ≥60 years at the distal radius by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and appendicular muscle mass (ASM) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Relative ASM of the upper limbs (RASM-u.l.) was calculated as ASM of the upper limbs/(height)(2). Grip strength was measured by dynanometry. In multivariable models, men in the lowest RASM-u.l. quartile had lower cross-sectional area (CSA), cortical area (Ct.Ar), cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and trabecular area (Tb.Ar) at distal radius compared with men in the highest quartile. The trends remained significant after adjustment for grip strength. Men in the lowest quartile of the normalized grip strength (grip strength/[height](2)) had lower aBMD, total vBMD, Ct.Ar, Ct.Th, Tb.vBMD, and Tb.N, and higher Tb.Sp and Tb.Sp.SD. The associations for Ct.Ar, total vBMD, Ct.Th, Tb.vBMD, and Tb.Sp remained significant after adjustment for RASM-u.l. In the models including RASM-u.l. and normalized grip strength, CSA and Tb.Ar were associated with RASM-u.l. but not with the strength. Lower Ct.Th, Tb.vBMD, and Tb.N were associated with lower grip strength but not with RASM-u.l. Lower Ct.Ar was associated with lower grip strength and with lower RASM-u.l. In conclusion, in older men, low RASM-u.l. and low grip strength are associated with poor cortical and trabecular microarchitecture partly independently of each other, after adjustment for confounders.},

abstract = {Background Few studies have evaluated the functional and electrophysiological correlates of hand-held grip dynamometry in neuromuscular disease. The practical value of normative values remains uncertain in clinical practice. We aimed to ascertain the value, clinical and electrophysiological correlates, as well as utility of normative values for grip dynamometry, in a cohort of subjects with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 31 prospectively recruited subjects with CIDP, using Jamar hand-held grip dynamometry, conventional clinical assessments and electrophysiology. Results Grip dynamometry correlated highly with motor, sensory and functional scores in the upper limbs as well as with global function. There were significant correlations with summated median/ulnar, and ulnar compound muscle action potentials. Patients' readings were significantly lower than median normative values but comparable to fifth percentile normative figures. Conclusions Jamar grip dynamometry is a reliable measure of global neurological status in patients with CIDP, not limited to upper limb or exclusively motor function. At optimum level of function, CIDP patients had comparable dynamometry recordings to fifth percentile normative values, which may represent a realistic aim for treated subjects with the disorder, with currently available therapies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In this longitudinal study chewing efficiency, maximum lip and bite force as well as masseter muscle thickness were evaluated and compared with hand-grip force.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one hospitalized stroke patients and 24 controls were recruited for this cohort study with 2-year follow-up. Chewing efficiency was evaluated with a color mixing ability test, lip forces with a traction dynamometer, bite force with a digital gauge, masseter muscle thickness using ultrasound measurements and grip strength with a hand dynamometer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the 2-year observation period, patients were evaluated four times. A total of 21 patients dropped out of the study. Stroke patients showed significantly impaired chewing efficiency and lower lip forces than controls with no significant improvement over time. Bite forces were not different between ipsi- and contralesional sides, in contrast to contralesional hand-grip strength which was significantly impaired and did not improve during the observation period. On the first examination with a median of 40 days after stroke, masseter thickness was reduced contralesional, but did not continue to show significant side-differences during follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Stroke affects the upper limb and the masseter muscles differently on a functional and morphological level. Further research is needed to evaluate the predictive value of oro-facial parameters on functional outcome after stroke.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: Impaired chewing efficiency and reduced lip force are quantifiable symptoms in stroke patients which seem not to improve in absence of oro-facial rehabilitation procedures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: low muscle strength is central to geriatric syndromes including sarcopenia and frailty. It is well described in community-dwelling older people, but the epidemiology of grip strength of older people in rehabilitation or long-term care has been little explored. OBJECTIVE: to describe grip strength of older people in rehabilitation and nursing home settings. DESIGN: cross-sectional epidemiological study. SETTING: three healthcare settings in one town. SUBJECTS: hundred and one inpatients on a rehabilitation ward, 47 community rehabilitation referrals and 100 nursing home residents. METHODS: grip strength, age, height, weight, body mass index, number of co-morbidities and medications, Barthel score, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), nutritional status and number of falls in the last year were recorded. RESULTS: grip strength differed substantially between healthcare settings for both men and women (P < 0.0001). Nursing home residents had the lowest age-adjusted mean grip strength and community rehabilitation referrals the highest. Broadly higher grip strength was associated in univariate analyses with younger age, greater height and weight, fewer comorbidities, higher Barthel score, higher MMSE score, better nutritional status and fewer falls. However, after mutual adjustment for these factors, the difference in grip strength between settings remained significant. The Barthel score was the characteristic most strongly associated with grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: older people in rehabilitation and care home settings had lower grip strength than reported for those living at home. Furthermore grip strength varied widely between healthcare settings independent of known major influences. Further research is required to ascertain whether grip strength may help identify people at risk of adverse health outcomes within these settings.},

What is the association of grip strength with age, gender, weight, and height in this population? Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Participants were recruited from schools in the northern provinces of the Netherlands. The study included healthy children and adolescents ranging in age from 4 to 15 years. Outcome measures: All children had their height (cm) and weight (kg) measured and were allowed a total of four attempts using the Jamar hand dynamometer: twice with each hand. Grip strength scores (kg) were recorded for the dominant and non-dominant hands. Results: The study population comprised 2241 children and adolescents. Reference values for both genders are provided according to age and dominance. Grip strength shows a linear and parallel progression for both genders until the age of 11 or 12, after which grip strength development shows an acceleration that is more prominent in boys. Conclusion: There is a significant difference in grip strength with each ascending year of age in favour of the older group, as well as a trend for boys to be stronger than girls in all age groups between 4 and 15 years.

Twenty-four juniors under 18 years old (age: 16.75 ± 0.62 years; body height: 184.5 ± 3.31 cm; body mass: 77.25 ± 3.22 kg) volunteered to participate in the study, and were divided into two groups. After a warm-up, both groups performed the basketball passing test and grip strength was recorded for each group under three different testing conditions: rest, 70\% and 90\% exercise intensity. The protocol used for the first group was the chest press, and for the second group the wrist curls. Results show that after the upper extremity fatigue protocol all parameters of the study (grip strength and passing accuracy) showed a significant decrease, and there was no significant difference between both groups regarding grip strength and passing accuracy. The study suggested that in order to avoid upper extremity fatigue, basketball trainers and coaches need to include upper extremity conditioning exercises into their training sessions.},

Different modes of treatment are used for management of tennis elbow. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of the taping technique (TT) on pain, grip strength and wrist extension force in treatment of tennis elbow. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients (16 men /14 women with a mean age of 32.2 years) with tennis elbow of their dominant arm participated in this study. Outcome measures were assessment of pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow, grip strength and wrist extension force before and five to ten minutes after application of elbow tape on the affected and unaffected arms. A Visual Analog Scale was used to assess pain. A dynamometer and a hand-held dynamometer were used for evaluation of grip strength and wrist extension force, respectively. RESULTS: Among the variables, significant differences were found in wrist extension forces between effected and unaffected arms (P = 0.02). Changes in grip strength showed statically significant improvements in the affected arm compared to the unaffected arm (P = 0.03). Also, in assessment of pain at the lateral epicondyle, the mean change between affected and unaffected arms was significant, with P = 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: The taping technique, as applied in this study demonstrates an impressive effect on wrist extension force and grip strength of patients with TE. Elbow taping also reduces pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow in these patients.},

abstract = {Grasping is a highly complex movement that requires the coordination of a number of hand joints and muscles. Previous studies showed that spinal premotor interneurons (PreM-INs) in the primate cervical spinal cord have divergent synaptic effects on hand motoneurons and that they might contribute to hand-muscle synergies. However, the extent to which these PreM-IN synaptic connections functionally contribute to modulating hand-muscle activity is not clear. In this paper, we explored the contribution of spinal PreM-INs to hand-muscle activation by quantifying the synaptic linkage (SL) and functional linkage (FL) of the PreM-INs with hand-muscle activities. The activity of 23 PreM-INs was recorded from the cervical spinal cord (C6-T1), with EMG signals measured simultaneously from hand and arm muscles in two macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task. Spike-triggered averages (STAs) of rectified EMGs were compiled for 456 neuron-muscle pairs; 63 pairs showed significant post-spike effects (PSEs; i.e., SL). Conversely, 231 of 456 pairs showed significant cross-correlations between the IN firing rate and rectified EMG (i.e., FL). Importantly, a greater proportion of the neuron-muscle pairs with SL showed FL (43/63 pairs, 68\%) compared with the pairs without SL (203/393, 52\%), and the presence of SL was significantly associated with that of FL. However, a significant number of pairs had SL without FL (SL∩!FL, n = 20) or FL without SL (!SL∩FL, n = 203), and the proportions of these incongruities exceeded the number expected by chance. These results suggested that spinal PreM-INs function to significantly modulate hand-muscle activity during precision grip, but the contribution of other neural structures is also needed to recruit an adequate combination of hand-muscle motoneurons.},

abstract = {The effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on hand-eye coordination and corrective response control during reach-to-grasp tasks remains unclear. Moderately impaired PD patients (n= 9) and age-matched controls (n= 12) reached to and grasped a virtual rectangular object, with haptic feedback provided to the thumb and index fingertip by two 3-degree of freedom manipulanda. The object rotated unexpectedly on a minority of trials, requiring subjects to adjust their grasp aperture. On half the trials, visual feedback of finger positions disappeared during the initial phase of the reach, when feedforward mechanisms are known to guide movement. PD patients were tested without (OFF) and with (ON) medication to investigate the effects of dopamine depletion and repletion on eye-hand coordination online corrective response control. We quantified eye-hand coordination by monitoring hand kinematics and eye position during the reach. We hypothesized that if the basal ganglia are important for eye-hand coordination and online corrections to object perturbations, then PD patients tested OFF medication would show reduced eye-hand spans and impoverished arm-hand coordination responses to the perturbation, which would be further exasperated when visual feedback of the hand was removed. Strikingly, PD patients tracked their hands with their gaze, and their movements became destabilized when having to make online corrective responses to object perturbations exhibiting pauses and changes in movement direction. These impairments largely remained even when tested in the ON state, despite significant improvement on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Our findings suggest that basal ganglia-cortical loops are essential for mediating eye-hand coordination and adaptive online responses for reach-to-grasp movements, and that restoration of tonic levels of dopamine may not be adequate to remediate this coordinative nature of basal ganglia-modulated function. © 2013 IBRO.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a recent trial in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), the ICE study, grip strength measurement captured significantly more improvement in patients receiving immune globulin (IGIV-C) intravenously than in those receiving placebo. METHODS: We conducted a systematic analysis to determine the sensitivity of grip strength as an indicator of meaningful clinical changes in CIDP. RESULTS: A randomized double-blind trial was undertaken in 117 CIDP patients who received IGIV-C or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 24 weeks. Grip strength and inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment (INCAT) disability scores were assessed at each visit, and the responsiveness of each scale was compared. A minimum clinically important difference cut-off value for grip strength (>8 kPa) and INCAT score (>1 point) was applied to assess the proportion of responders to IGIV-C versus placebo. This analysis showed that grip strength demonstrated significant improvement earlier (as early as day 16) than the INCAT disability scale in patients receiving IGIV-C compared with placebo. A significantly higher proportion of improvers were seen in the IGIV-C group (37.5\%-50.9\%) than in the placebo group (21.1\%-25.9\%) for grip strength at day 16, week 3, week 6 and the end of the first period. Also, grip strength showed within the first 6 weeks in the placebo group significantly more patients with a clinically meaningful deterioration (>8 kPa), compared with the INCAT (>1-point deterioration) findings. CONCLUSIONS: Grip strength can be considered a sensitive tool for assessing clinically relevant changes in patients with CIDP. Its use in daily practice is suggested.},

abstract = {Unilateral hand clenching increases neuronal activity in the frontal lobe of the contralateral hemisphere. Such hand clenching is also associated with increased experiencing of a given hemisphere's "mode of processing." Together, these findings suggest that unilateral hand clenching can be used to test hypotheses concerning the specializations of the cerebral hemispheres during memory encoding and retrieval. We investigated this possibility by testing effects of unilateral hand clenching on episodic memory. The hemispheric Encoding/Retrieval Asymmetry (HERA) model proposes left prefrontal regions are associated with encoding, and right prefrontal regions with retrieval, of episodic memories. It was hypothesized that right hand clenching (left hemisphere activation) pre-encoding, and left hand clenching (right hemisphere activation) pre-recall, would result in superior memory. Results supported the HERA model. Also supported was that simple unilateral hand clenching can be used as a means by which the functional specializations of the cerebral hemispheres can be investigated in intact humans.},

abstract = {Surface electromyography (EMG) is widely used to evaluate forearm muscle function and predict hand grip forces; however, there is a lack of literature on its intra-session and inter-day reliability. The aim of this study was to determine reliability of surface EMG of finger and wrist flexor muscles across varying grip forces. Surface EMG was measured from six forearm flexor muscles of 23 healthy adults. Eleven of these subjects undertook inter-day test-retest. Six repetitions of five randomized isometric grip forces between 0\% and 80\% of maximum force (MVC) were recorded and normalized to MVC. Intra- and inter-day reliability were calculated through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM).Normalized EMG produced excellent intra-session ICC of 0.90 when repeated measurements were averaged. Intra-session SEM was low at low grip forces, however, corresponding normalized SEM was high (23-45\%) due to the small magnitude of EMG signals. This may limit the ability to evaluate finer forearm muscle function and hand grip forces in daily tasks. Combining EMG of functionally related muscles improved intra-session SEM, improving within-subject reliability without taking multiple measurements. Removing and replacing electrodes inter-day produced poor ICC (ICC. <. 0.50) but did not substantially affect SEM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background Upper limb (UL) burns can result in significant loss of strength and physical function. The aim of this study was to establish the reliability and validity of grip strength dynamometry (GSD) for measuring burn-affected UL strength over time. Methods A retrospective sample of adult participants (n = 89) with UL burns was obtained from Royal Perth Hospital. Data were compiled from assessments conducted at discharge, one, three, six and 12 months afer burn. Within-session reliability and validity was examined through multivariable analyses. Results GSD demonstrated within-session reliability for all investigated timepoints (ICC's ≥ 0.87, p < 0.0005.) Criterion validity was confirmed with GSD and QuickDASH being significantly associated in both right (b = 0.17, p = 0.002) and left (b = 0.14, p = 0.002) hands. Construct validity was demonstrated through significant association of GSD values with location of burn (p < 0.35); time after burn (p < 0.012); surgical intervention (p = 0.003) and burn size (p < 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that grip strength dynamometry is a reliable and valid outcome measure for measuring burn-affected UL strength from one month to one year after burn. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.},

Using all available data (n = 584 enrollment visits, 1689 follow-up visits, total of 2273 visits) from a prospective observational cohort study, we explored the relationship between HGS and 2MWT and patient-reported measures (Lee symptom scale, MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36], and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy [FACT]-Bone Marrow Transplantation quality of life instruments and Human Activity Profile [HAP]), chronic GVHD global severity (National Institutes of Health global score, clinician global score, and patient-reported global score), calculated and clinician-reported chronic GVHD response, and mortality (overall survival, nonrelapse mortality, and failure-free survival) in multivariable analyses adjusted for significant covariates. 2MWT was significantly associated with intuitive domains of the Lee Symptom Scale (overall, skin, lung, energy), SF-36 domain and summary scores, FACT summary and domain scores, and HAP scores (all P < .001). Fewer associations were detected with the HGS. The 2MWT and HGS both had significant association with global chronic GVHD severity. In multivariable analysis, 2MWT was significantly associated with overall survival, nonrelapse mortality, and failure-free survival, whereas no association was found for HGS. 2MWT and HGS were not sensitive to National Institutes of Health or clinician-reported response. Based on independent association with mortality, these data support the importance of the 2MWT for identification of high-risk chronic GVHD patients. However, change in 2MWT is not sensitive to chronic GVHD response, limiting its usefulness in clinical trials. © 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.},

abstract = {Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) constitutes a critical cortical node in the sensorimotor system in which goal-directed actions are computed. This information then must be transferred into commands suitable for hand movements to the primary motor cortex (M1). Complexity arises because reach-to-grasp actions not only require directing the hand towards the object (transport component), but also preshaping the hand according to the features of the object (grip component). Yet, the functional influence that specific PPC regions exert over ipsilateral M1 during the planning of different hand movements remains unclear in humans. Here we manipulated transport and grip components of goal-directed hand movements and exploited paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) to probe the functional interactions between M1 and two different PPC regions, namely superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) and the anterior region of the intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), in the left hemisphere. We show that when the extension of the arm is required to contact a target object, SPOC selectively facilitates motor evoked potentials, suggesting that SPOC-M1 interactions are functionally specific to arm transport. In contrast, a different pathway, linking the aIPS and ipsilateral M1, shows enhanced functional connections during the sensorimotor planning of grip. These results support recent human neuroimaging findings arguing for specialized human parietal regions for the planning of arm transport and hand grip during goal-directed actions. Importantly, they provide new insight into the causal influences these different parietal regions exert over ipsilateral motor cortex for specific types of planned hand movements. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These measurements were taken before surgery and at 3 and 6 months after the procedure. When we compared the averages of all forces measured in the affected hand before the surgery with all forces measured at 3 months postoperative, we found no significant differences. However, after 6 months, we found significant differences for all four strength tests as compared with those measurements taken preoperatively and at the 3 month time point.

abstract = {This paper proposes a robotic hand rehabilitation device for grasp training. The device is designed for stroke patients to train and recover their hand grasp function in order to undertake activities of daily living (ADL). The device consists of a control unit, two small actuators, an infrared (IR) sensor, and pressure sensors in the grasp handle. The advantages of this device are that it is small in size, inexpensive, and available for use at home without specialist's supervision. In addition, a novel patient-driven strategy based on the patient's movement intention detected by the pressure sensors without bio-signals is introduced. Once the system detects a patient's movement intention, it triggers the robotic device to move the patient's hand to form the normal grasping behavior. This strategy may encourage stroke patients to participate in rehabilitation training to recover their hand grasp function and it may also enhance neural plasticity. A user study was conducted in order to investigate the usability, acceptability, satisfaction, and suggestions for improvement of the proposed device. The results of this survey included positive reviews from therapists and a stroke patient. In particular, therapists expected that the proposed patient-driven mode can motivate patients for their rehabilitation training and it can be effective to prevent a compensational strategy in active movements. It is expected that the proposed device will assist stroke patients in restoring their grasp function efficiently.},

In previous analyses of the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the 1946 British birth cohort, there was no evidence of an association between leisure time physical activity (LTPA) across adulthood and grip strength at age 53. This study tested the hypothesis that cumulative benefits of LTPA across mid-life on grip strength will have emerged by age 60-64.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: data from the MRC NSHD were used to investigate the associations between LTPA at ages 36, 43, 53 and 60-64 and grip strength at 60-64. Linear regression models were constructed to examine the effect of activity at each age separately and as a cumulative score, including adjustment for potential confounders and testing of life course hypotheses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: there were complete longitudinal data available for 1,645 participants. There was evidence of a cumulative effect of LTPA across mid-life on grip strength at 60-64.

As these associations have emerged since age 53, it suggests that LTPA across adulthood may prevent decline in grip strength in early old age.},

abstract = {Purpose Regaining hand function has been identified as the highest priority for persons with tetraplegia. In many patients, finger flexion can be restored with a tendon transfer of extensor carpi radialis longus to flexor digitorum profundus (FDP). In the absence of intrinsic function, this results in a roll-up finger movement, which tends to push large objects out of grasp. To enable patients to grasp objects of varying sizes, a functional grasp is required that has a larger excursion of fingertip-to-palm distance than can be supplied without intrinsic function. The aim of this study was to quantify the role of intrinsic muscle force in creating a functional grasp. Methods Finger kinematics during grasp were measured on 5 cadaveric hands. To simulate finger flexion, the FDP was activated by a motor and intrinsic muscles were loaded at various levels (0, 125, 250, 375, or 500 g). Finger movement was characterized by the order of metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalangeal joint flexion and by the maximal fingertip-to-palm distance during finger closure. Results Without any intrinsic muscle contribution (0-g load), FDP activation resulted in flexion of all 3 joints, whereby flexion began at the proximal interphalangeal joint, followed by the distal interphalangeal joint, and then the metacarpophalangeal joint. With increasing intrinsic muscle load, finger flexion was initiated at the metacarpophalangeal joint, followed by the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. This altered joint flexion order resulted in a larger maximal fingertip-to-palm distance during finger flexion. The difference between the 2 extreme conditions (0 g vs 500 g of intrinsic muscle load) was 19 mm. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that simultaneous activation of the FDP and the intrinsic muscles results in an apparently more functional hand closing compared with FDP activation alone because of altered kinematics and larger fingertip-to-palm distances. Clinical relevance These findings suggest that intrinsic muscle balancing during reconstruction of grasp in tetraplegic patients may improve function. © 2013 by the AmericanSociety for Surgery of the Hand.

abstract = {The identification of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in skeletal muscle tissue and research in muscle strength and development in VDR-null mice confirms a role for vitamin D in muscle function. The relationship between muscle strength and vitamin D status has been explored to some degree in older populations with regard to fall prevention, but there has been very little research in younger adults. This cross-sectional study considered the predictors of muscle strength in 137 young women (19-29 years) living in New Zealand. The following measurements were taken in the latter months of winter: plasma 25OHD, dominant (HGD) and non-dominant hand-grip (HGND) strength (hand-grip dynamometer), counter measure jump, and recreational physical activity (RPA) assessed from a recent physical activity questionnaire (RPAQ). Dietary intake was measured with a four-day food diary, and body composition using air displacement plethysmography. This was a relatively inactive group of women; total RPA ranged from 0 to 3.93h per week, mean (SD) 0.86(0.74) h, approximately 50\% comprised outdoor activities. Mean 25OHD was 54(28)nmol/l, HGD and HGND were significantly different (t=6.049, p<0.001) at 27.3(5.8) and 25.6(5.7)kg respectively. Total RPA and 25OHD were entered into a linear regression model with handgrip strength as the dependent variable (Model R(2)=0.11, p=0.001 non-dominant, R(2)=0.13, p<0.001 dominant). Serum 25OHD was significantly associated with HGD (B(SE)=0.05(0.02), p=0.016) and HGND (B(SE)=0.04(0.02), p=0.019), independent of recreational physical activity. Recreational activity had an association with both hand-grip strength and serum 25OHD, and when each were adjusted to remove this association, 25OHD accounted for 4.3\% of HGND and 4.5\% of HGD. These results suggest that vitamin D status does have a small but significant association with hand-grip strength in this group of young women. Further investigation in this age group with a randomised controlled trial is justified. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Vitamin D Workshop'.},

We investigated the relationship between latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels, muscle size and strength in a group of healthy older community-dwelling people.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants were healthy volunteers from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study. Participants had IL-6 level and CMV antibody titre measured at age 70 years and grip strength and a volumetric T1-weighted MRI brain scan (allowing measurement of neck muscle cross-sectional area (CSA)) at age 73. Markers of childhood deprivation were adjusted for in the analysis due to correlations between childhood deprivation and latent CMV infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 866 participants were studied; 448 men (mean age 72.48 years, sd 0.70) and 418 women (mean age 72.51 years, sd 0.72). In men, CMV seropositivity was associated with smaller neck muscle CSA (p = 0.03, partial eta squared = 0.01), even after adjustment for IL-6 levels. Neck muscle CSA was not associated with CMV seropositivity in women, or CMV antibody titre or IL-6 level in either sex. Grip strength associated negatively with IL-6 level (right grip strength p<0.00001, partial eta squared 0.032 and left grip strength p<0.00001, partial eta squared 0.027) with or without adjustment for CMV serostatus or antibody titre. CMV status and antibody titre were not significantly associated with grip strength in either hand.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between markers of immunosenescence (i.e. CMV serostatus and IL6 level) and low muscle mass and strength and longitudinal studies in older cohorts are now required to investigate these relationships further.},

abstract = {Level-anchored ratio scaling, such as the Borg CR10 scale?? and the Borg CR100 scale??, uses verbal anchors in congruence with numbers to give ratio data together with natural levels of intensity. This presupposes that the anchors possess natural positions in the subjective dynamic range and also "numerical" inter-relations. In an experiment, subjects had to produce a force of handgrip corresponding to their conception of "Strong", followed by a "Maximal" performance. By using the previously found relationship between "Strong" and "Maximal" of 1:2 together with knowledge of the exponent in the power S-R-function (R=c??Sn) for grip strength, n=1.8, predictions of individual maximal performances were obtained. The predicted values correlated 0.76 with, and deviated only 3\% (ns) from, actual maximal performances of grip strength. This result -as previously also found for aerobic capacity-gives a strong support for the use of verbal anchors, so common in category scaling, also in "ratio scaling" and that the Borg CR-scales fulfill the requirements for ratio scales. For estimation of muscular strength, such as grip strength, this present study points to the value of using submaximal determinations as a compliment to maximal performances (e.g., to obtain measures of functional capacity). The results also support the increasingly common use of the CR-methodology in other ergonomic settings concerning suitable design of tools and equipment. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

abstract = {Behavioral studies suggest that visual attention is biased toward stimuli in the region of space near the palm of the hand, but it is unclear whether this effect is universal or selective for goal/task-related stimuli. We examined event-related potentials (ERPs) using a visual detection task in which the hand was placed near or kept far from target and non-target stimuli that were matched for frequency and visual features to avoid confounding factors. Focusing on attention-sensitive ERP components, we found that P3 (350-450 ms) amplitudes were increased for Hand Near conditions for targets only, demonstrating a selective effect consistent with the P3's cross-modal and task-relevance influences. An N1 variant implicated in visuo-tactile integration (central Nd1; 120-190 ms) showed similar target-specific effects. P1 (80-110 ms) effects for target stimuli were also apparent, but may have applied to non-targets as well, which would be consistent with the P1's association with early, pre-categorical increases in sensory gain. Collectively, these findings suggest that by the time stimuli are categorized as relevant/irrelevant for action, the proprioceptive effects of the hand on visual attention are selective for goal/task-related stimuli. At the same time, hand proximity appears to bias attention early, starting with a facilitation of processing for perhaps any visual stimuli near the hand, and continuing with enhancements that are selective to those stimuli categorized as task-relevant.},

abstract = {Acidification has been reported to provide protective effects on force production in vitro. Thus, in this study, we tested if respiratory acid-base changes influence muscle function and excitability in vivo. Nine subjects performed strenuous, intermittent hand grip exercises (10 cycles of 15 s of work/45 s of rest) under respiratory acidosis by CO(2) rebreathing, alkalosis by hyperventilation, or control. The Pco(2), pH, K(+) concentration ([K(+)]), and Na(+) concentration were measured in venous and arterialized blood. Compound action potentials (M-wave) were elicited to examine the excitability of the sarcolemma. The surface electromyogram (EMG) was recorded to estimate the central drive to the muscle. The lowest venous pH during the exercise period was 7.24 ± 0.03 in controls, 7.31 ± 0.05 with alkalosis, and 7.17 ± 0.04 with acidosis (P < 0.001). The venous [K(+)] rose to similar maximum values in all conditions (6.2 ± 0.8 mmol/l). The acidification reduced the decline in contraction speed (P < 0.001) but decreased the M-wave area to 73.4 ± 19.8\% (P < 0.001) of the initial value. After the first exercise cycle, the M-wave area was smaller with acidosis than with alkalosis, and, after the second cycle, it was smaller with acidosis than with the control condition (P < 0.001). The duration of the M-wave was not affected. Acidification diminished the reduction in performance, although the M-wave area during exercise was decreased. Respiratory alkalosis stabilized the M-wave area without influencing performance. Thus, we did not find a direct link between performance and alteration of excitability of the sarcolemma due to changes in pH in vivo.},

abstract = {The use of force-time curves in rheumatoid hands was investigated to assess peak force, average force, total grip time, area under the curve, and variability of the plateau region of the curves to identify the impact of different rheumatoid hand deformities on grip strength. We studied 43 patients - 10 men and 33 women - with established rheumatoid arthritis affecting their hands. Mean age was 61 years and mean duration of hand involvement was 13 years. Of the 86 hands, 38 had no finger deformity, eight had metacarpophalangeal joint ulnar deviation without any additional finger deformities, 16 had swan neck deformities, and 10 had boutonni\`{e}re deformities. Fourteen hands had a combination of deformities. The hands with combined deformities were the weakest, had poor grip strength (34.7 N, SE 8), and were able to sustain grip for only a short time (22 sec, SE 3). Swan neck deformity also profoundly affects the magnitude (49.8 N, SE 7) and sustainability of grip (15 sec, SE 2). Even when only one finger had a swan neck deformity the mean strength was poor at 45 N. Swan neck deformity causes greater loss of strength than boutonni\`{e}re deformity (82.7 N, SE 15). The strongest rheumatoid hands were those with only ulnar deviation deformities (90.8 N, SE 14). The area under the curve best predicted disability assessed using the Patient Evaluation Measure.},

Admission grip strength is associated with discharge outcomes in acute hospital settings. OBJECTIVE: to explore the relationship between grip strength and length of stay in older rehabilitation in-patients. DESIGN: single-centre prospective cohort study. SETTING: community hospital rehabilitation ward. SUBJECTS: one hundred and ten patients aged 70 years and over. METHODS: data on age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, medication, residence, grip strength, physical function, cognitive function, frailty, falls, discharge destination and length of stay were recorded. RESULTS: higher grip strength was associated with reduced length of stay, characterised by an increased likelihood of discharge to usual residence among male rehabilitation in-patients (hazard ratio 1.09 (95\% confidence interval 1.01, 1.17) per kilo increase in grip strength, P = 0.02) after adjustment for age and size. CONCLUSIONS: this is the first prospective study to show that stronger grip strength, particularly among male in-patients, is associated with a shorter length of stay in a rehabilitation ward. This is important because it demonstrates that grip strength can be discriminatory among frailer people. Further research into the clinical applications of grip strength measurement in rehabilitation settings is needed.},

All the geometry was represented using a spherical extension of polytopes (s-topes) for efficient collision detection. The model was used to simulate an experiment in which a subject was asked to grasp two cylinders of different diameters and weights. Different objective functions were checked to solve the indeterminate problem. The normal finger forces estimated by the model were compared to those experimentally measured. The popular objective function sum of the squared muscle stresses was shown not suitable for the grasping simulation, requiring at least being complemented by task-dependent grasp quality measures.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess how age-related social comparisons, which are likely to arise inadvertently or deliberately during assessments, may affect older people's performance on tests that are used to assess their needs and capability. DESIGN: The study randomly assigned participants to a comparison with younger people or a no comparison condition and assessed hand grip strength and persistence. Gender, education, type of residence, arthritis and age were also recorded. SETTING: Age UK centres and senior's lunches in the South of England. PARTICIPANTS: An opportunity sample of 56 adults, with a mean age of 82.25 years. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Hand grip strength measured using a manual hand dynamometer and persistence of grip measured using a stopwatch. RESULTS: Comparison caused significantly worse performance measured by both strength (comparison =6.85 kg, 95\% CI 4.19 kg to 9.5 kg, control group =11.07 kg, 95\% CI 8.47 kg to 13.68 kg, OR =0.51, p=0.027) and persistence (comparison =8.36 s, 95\% CI 5.44 s to 11.29 s; control group =12.57 s, 95\% CI 9.7 s to 15.45 s, OR =0.49, p=0.045). These effects remained significant after accounting for differences in arthritis, gender, education and adjusting for population age norms. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the potential for age comparisons and negative stereotype activation during assessment of older people, such assessments may underestimate physical capability by up to 50\%. Because age comparisons are endemic, this means that assessment tests may sometimes seriously underestimate older people's capacity and prognosis, which has implications for the way healthcare professionals treat them in terms of autonomy and dependency.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is increasing interest in physical performance as it relates to both the current and future health of older people. It is often characterised using the Short Physical Performance Battery including assessment of gait speed, chair rises and standing balance. However this battery of tests may not be feasible in all clinical settings and simpler measures may be required. As muscle strength is central to physical performance, we explored whether grip strength could be used as a marker of the Short Physical Performance Battery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To examine associations between grip strength and components of the Short Physical Performance Battery in older community dwelling men and women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Grip strength measurement and the Short Physical Performance Battery were completed in 349 men and 280 women aged 63-73 years taking part in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS). Relationships between grip strength and physical performance (6m timed-up-and-go [TUG], 3m walk, chair rises and standing balance times) were analysed using linear and logistic regression, without and with adjustment for age, anthropometry, lifestyle factors and co-morbidities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among men, a kilo increase in grip strength was associated with a 0.07s (second) decrease in 6m TUG, a 0.02s decrease in 3m walk time, and a 1\% decrease in chair rises time (p<0.001 for all). Among women, a kilo increase in grip strength was associated with a 0.13s decrease in 6m TUG, a 0.03s decrease in 3m walk time, and a 1\% decrease in chair rises time (p<0.001). Higher grip strength was associated with better balance among men (p=0.01) but not women (p=0.57). Adjustment for age, anthropometry, lifestyle and co-morbidities did not alter these results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Grip strength is a good marker of physical performance in this age group and may be more feasible than completing a short physical performance battery in some clinical settings.},

Methods: A single-blinded, prospective, comparative, pilot, randomized, clinical trial was performed with 18 athletes of both sexes from a judo team currently competing on a national level. The athletes were randomly assigned to 2 groups: chiropractic SMT and sham. Three interventions were performed on each of the athletes at different time points. Force measurements were obtained by a hydraulic dynamometer immediately before and after each intervention at the same period before training up to 3 weeks with at least 36 hours between interventions. Results: Analysis of grip strength data revealed a statistically significant increase in strength within the treatment group after the first intervention (6.95\% right, 12.61\% left) as compared with the second (11.53\% right, 17.02\% left) and the third interventions (10.53\% right, 16.81\% left). No statistically significant differences were found in grip strength comparison within the sham group. Overall differences in strength were consistently significant between the study groups (P =.0025). Conclusion: The present study suggests that the grip strength of national level judo athletes receiving chiropractic SMT improved compared to those receiving sham. ?? 2012 National University of Health Sciences.},

An innovative grip-strength evaluation tool, the Grip-Ball has been developed for remote assessment of grip-strength. The Grip-Ball is an airtight ball that can be inflated to different pressures, thus varying the stiffness of the ball and the grip-strength dynamics. Three different initial pressures of 100, 125, and 150 kPa were evaluated in respect to reliability and validity, when compared to the Jamar. Reliability was very high, with ICC values of 0.95, 0.98, and 0.99 for 100, 125, and 150 kPa, respectively. The new device was highly correlated with the force measured using the Jamar for all initial pressures (r= 0.88, 0.93, and 0.93 for 100, 125, and 150 kPa, respectively). The possibility of varying the initial pressure would enable the Grip-Ball to be used for standard grip-strength testing and rehabilitation, while still maintaining high reliability and validity.},

The BBT scores and time for seven movements (finger closing, contact to lift-off, transport before barrier, transport after barrier, release, return, and reach) were compared across the three block types. Results: The mean BBT score was 8\% higher for the rubber blocks than the paper and wooden blocks (p,0.01) due to the reduced time for contact to lift-off (when the finger touches a block until the block is lifted). Conclusions: Hand function assessments should be controlled for object surfaces. Therapists may vary grip difficulties by changing object surfaces.

abstract = {Relationships between birthweight and grip strength throughout the life course
suggest that early influences on the growth and development of muscle are important
for long-term muscle function. However, little is known about parental influences on
children’s grip strength. We have explored this in the Southampton Women’s Survey,
a prospective general population cohort study from before conception through childhood.
Grip strength was measured using a Jamar handgrip dynamometer in the
mother at 19 weeks’ gestation and her partner, and in the child at age 4 years. Prepregnancy
heights and weights were measured in the mothers; reported weights and
measured heights were available for the fathers.
Complete data on parents and children were available for 444 trios. In univariable
analyses, both parents’ grip strengths were significantly associated with that of the
child (r = 0.17, P < 0.001 for mothers; r = 0.15, P = 0.002 for fathers). These correlations
were similar to that between the grip strength of the mothers and the fathers (r = 0.17,
P < 0.001). In the multivariable model, after adjustment for child’s height and physical
activity, the correlations with the child’s grip strength were attenuated, being 0.10
(P = 0.02) and 0.11 (P = 0.01) for mothers’ and fathers’ grip strength respectively. The
findings show that grip strength of each parent is associated with that of the child,
indicating that heritable influences and the shared family environment influence the
development of muscle strength. This contributes to our understanding of the role of
heritable and environmental factors on early muscle growth and development, which
are important for muscle function across the life course.},

Isokinetic measures of peak torque and work during shoulder rotations and scapular protraction-retraction movements were obtained with the isokinetic dynamometer at a speed of 60°/s. Pearson correlation coefficients between isometric HG and isokinetic strength data ranged between 0.60 and 0.82 for the peak torque and between 0.59 and 0.86 for the isokinetic work.

We tested 14 arms in seven healthy males. WES and GS were measured before blocking as standard WES and standard GS. All participants then had radial nerve blocks with mepivacaine hydrochloride. During the recovery process from radial nerve blockade, WES and GS were recorded every 5 minutes. There was a very strong correlation between WES and GS (p < 0.0001).

abstract = {Brain activity during motor performance becomes more widespread and less lateralized with advancing age in response to ongoing degenerative processes. In this study, we were interested in the mechanism by which this change in the pattern of activity supports motor performance with advancing age. We used both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess age related changes in motor system connectivity during isometric hand grip. Paired pulse TMS was used to measure the change in interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from contralateral M1 (cM1) to ipsilateral M1 (iM1) during right hand grip. Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) of fMRI data was used to investigate the effect of age on causal interactions throughout the cortical motor network during right hand grip. Bayesian model selection was used to identify the causal model that best explained the data for all subjects. Firstly, we confirmed that the TMS and DCM measures both demonstrated a less inhibitory/more facilitatory influence of cM1 on iM1 during hand grip with advancing age. These values correlated with one another providing face validity for our DCM measures of connectivity. We found increasing reciprocal facilitatory influences with advancing age (i) between all ipsilateral cortical motor areas and (ii) between cortical motor areas of both hemispheres and iM1. There were no differences in the performance of our task with ageing suggesting that the ipsilateral cortical motor areas, in particular iM1, play a central role in maintaining performance levels with ageing through increasingly facilitatory cortico-cortical influences. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Grip-ball is a new dynamometer used to evaluate grip strength, as well as for use in home-based rehabilitation of the hand and forearm. The Grip-ball consists of pressure and temperature sensors and an electronic wireless communication system contained in an airtight ball. That can be inflated to different pressures. The device has advantages over standard dynamometers in that it looks like a simple ball, and can wirelessly communicate via Bluetooth to any compatible receiver, thus have potential to be used for clinical assessment and rehabilitation in a remote setting. The reliability and reproducibility of the device were assessed for the pressure sensor itself, as well as the relationship between the force applied and the pressure measured by the Grip-ball. The initial validation was performed using the pressure sensor without the ball in order to confirm the accuracy of the sensor used. A second validation study was conducted using the Grip-ball rather than just its sensor to examine the relationship between the pressure measured inside the ball and force applied. The results showed that there is a very good correlation (r=0.997, p<0.05) between the pressure measured by the Grip-ball sensor and that measured by a Vigorimeter, thus confirming the reliability of the sensor used in the Grip-ball. A quadratic regression equation was calculated in order to predict the force applied based on the pressure measured inside the ball, and the initial pressure to which the ball was inflated (R2=0.97, standard error 10.9N). Such a finding compares favourably with the variability inherent in Jamar recordings, thus indicating that the Grip-ball could be used to assess grip force. An industrial version of the Grip-ball, which is currently under development, will be able to be used for the entire range of grip force in the population. © 2012 IPEM.},

abstract = {In the last decade, an increasing interest has arisen in investigating the relationship between the electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements of brain activity, such as EEG and (BOLD) fMRI. In particular, changes in BOLD have been shown to be associated with changes in the spectral profile of neural activity, rather than with absolute power. Concurrently, recent findings showed that different EEG rhythms are independently related to changes in the BOLD signal: therefore, it would be also important to distinguish between the contributions of the different EEG rhythms to BOLD fluctuations when modeling the relationship between the two signals. Here we propose a method to perform EEG-informed fMRI analysis where the changes in the spectral profile are modeled, and, at the same time, the distinction between rhythms is preserved. We compared our model with two other frequency-dependent regressors modeling using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data from healthy subjects performing a motor task. Our results showed that the proposed method better captures the correlations between BOLD signal and EEG rhythms modulations, identifying task-related, well localized activated volumes. Furthermore, we showed that including among the regressors also EEG rhythms not primarily involved in the task enhances the performance of the analysis, even when only correlations with BOLD signal and specific EEG rhythms are explored.},

@article{Trampisch2012,
abstract = {Purpose: Hand grip strength is an indicator of general muscle strength that is measured using a hand dynamometer. In some studies, a subject's grip strength is taken to be the maximal grip strength achieved from measurements taken at several different dynamometer handle positions. However, little is known about the influence of these different positions on the measured grip strength. The aim of the study was to identify one standard handle position that could be used to assess the grip strength of all subjects. Methods: Grip strength was assessed with a hand dynamometer (Jamar Plus+; Sammons Preston, Rolyon, Bolingbrook, IL). Each participant's grip strength was measured 3 times in each of 5 different handle positions with each hand. The best position for each participant was defined as the position at which they achieved maximal grip strength. Results: The mean (?? standard deviation) age of the 50 participants was 41 (?? 13) years. Maximal grip strength was 43.7 (?? 12.4) kg for all participants; 55.0 (?? 10.2) kg for men and 35.4 (?? 5.2) kg for women. Handle position 2 was the best position for 70\% of participants. The mean difference between the grip strength achieved by each participant at handle position 2 and that achieved at each participant's best position was 0.8 (?? 1.78) kg. Conclusions: Our results show that measurements taken at a single standard handle position are sufficiently accurate to assess grip strengths for all subjects. We therefore recommend handle position 2 as the standard position for measuring grip strength with the Jamar Plus+ hand dynamometer. Clinical relevance: The assessment of grip strength with the Jamar Plus+ dynamometer is easier and faster if a single, standard handle position is used rather than multiple different positions. As well as providing accurate results, a single, standard handle position also reduces fatigue and increases the comparability of results between subjects. ?? 2012 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interpreting the impact of hand osteoarthritis (OA) on hand function is complicated owing to the multiple digits and joints in the hand. QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: We determined the impact of digit-related radiographic OA on hand function in patients 65 years or older. METHODS: We evaluated hand radiographs in 196 men and 182 women older than 65 years without shoulder or elbow pain who participated in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. Using the Kellgren and Lawrence criteria, we graded the 15 joints in each hand from 0 to 4 for OA, and evaluated hand function by measuring DASH scores and grip and pinch strength of dominant hands. We performed multiple linear regression analyses to evaluate associations between hand functions and the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grade of each digit. RESULTS: The sums of Kellgren and Lawrence grades for thumbs and middle fingers were independently associated with grip strength, and the sums of the Kellgren and Lawrence grades for thumbs and index fingers were independently associated with pinch strength after controlling for age and sex. DASH scores were independently associated with OA of the thumb, or index or middle finger, but not with OA of the ring or small finger. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed cumulative effects of joint involvement and Kellgren and Lawrence grades of thumb and middle finger OA on grip strength, and thumb and index finger OA on pinch strength. Furthermore, OA of either of three radial digits was associated with more severe upper extremity disabilities. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, diagnostic study.

abstract = {In humans, propriospinal neurons located at midcervical levels receive peripheral and corticospinal inputs and probably participate in the control of grip tasks, but their role in reaching movements, as observed in cats and primates, is still an open question. The effect of ulnar nerve stimulation on flexor carpi radialis (FCR) motor evoked potential (MEP) was tested during reaching tasks and tonic wrist flexion. Significant MEP facilitation was observed at the end of reach during reach-to-grasp but not during grasp, reach-to-point, or tonic contractions. MEP facilitation occurred at a longer interstimulus interval than expected for convergence of corticospinal and afferent volleys at motoneuron level and was not paralleled by a change in the H-reflex. These findings suggest convergence of the two volleys at propriospinal level. Ulnar-induced MEP facilitation was observed when conditioning stimuli were at 0.75 motor response threshold (MT), but not 1 MT. This favors an increased excitability of propriospinal neurons rather than depression of their feedback inhibition, as has been observed during tonic power grip tasks. It is suggested that the ulnar-induced facilitation of FCR MEP during reach may be due to descending activation of propriospinal neurons, assisting the early recruitment of large motoneurons for rapid movement. Because the feedback inhibitory control is still open, this excitation can be truncated by cutaneous inputs from the palmar side of the hand during grasp, thus assisting movement termination. It is concluded that the feedforward activation of propriospinal neurons and their feedback control may be involved in the internal model, motor planning, and online adjustments for reach-to-grasp movements in humans.},

abstract = {An efficient uncoupling process is generally considered to have a protective effect on the aging muscle by slowing down its age-related decay. Genetic polymorphisms in the Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene, whose product is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, were suggested to be associated with hand grip (HG) performances in elderly populations. Considering the population specificity of the quality of aging, we aimed to add further support to this evidence by analyzing the association between four SNPs in the UCP3 gene and relative haplotypes in two large cohorts of middle aged (N= 708) and oldest old Danes (N= 908). We found that the variability at rs1685354 and rs11235972 was associated with HG levels both at single and haplotypic level in both cohorts. Furthermore, taking advantage of large cohort and period survival data of the oldest cohort, we tested the association of each SNP with survival at 10. years from the baseline visit.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: . More than 150 000 neuroprostheses (NPs) have been implanted in people to restore bodily function in a variety of neural disorders. The authors developed a novel NP, the Stimulus Router System (SRS), in which only passive leads are implanted. Each lead picks up a portion of the current delivered through the skin by an external stimulator.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: . The authors report on the first human implant of an SRS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: . The recipient was a tetraplegic man with bilateral hand paralysis. Three SRS leads were implanted in his right forearm to activate the finger extensors, finger flexors, and thumb flexor. A wristlet containing a surface stimulator and electrodes was used to pass trains of electrical pulses through the skin to each lead. Hand opening and grasp were controlled via a wireless earpiece that sensed small tooth-clicks and transmitted signals to the wristlet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: . The current required to activate the muscles was less than half that required prior to implantation and below perceptual threshold. Maximal grip force and hand opening aperture were both larger using the SRS. The implanted leads have remained functional for 3 years. The recipient reported various tasks of daily life that improved during SRS usage. An electronic counter revealed mean monthly usage of 18.5 hours, equivalent to 55 hours of continuous manual activity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: . This first implant of the SRS indicates that it can be effective and reliable and has potential to provide an alternative to existing NPs.},

abstract = {Neuroanatomical changes in the aging brain are widely distributed rather than focal. We investigated age-related changes in large-scale functional brain networks by applying graph theory to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during a simple grip task with either dominant or nondominant hand. We measured the effect of age on efficiency of information transfer within a series of hierarchical functional networks composed of the whole brain or component parts of the whole brain. Global efficiency was maintained with aging during dominant hand use, primarily due to increased efficiency in parietal-occipital-cerebellar-related networks. During nondominant hand use, global efficiency, as well as efficiency within ipsilateral hemisphere and between hemispheres declined with age. This was attributable largely to frontal-temporal-limbic-cerebellar-related networks. Increased efficiency with age was seen in networks involving parietal-occipital regions, but unlike for dominant hand use, this topological reconfiguration could not maintain the level of global efficiency. Here, graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated both compensatory and noncompensatory changes in topological configuration of large-scale networks during aging depending on the task. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to use a pressure sensor to measure the force distribution and contact area of the hand when gripping, pushing, and pulling a cylinder. Data was collected from 10 subjects with no hand impairments and from 1 subject with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subjects grasped an aluminum cylinder wrapped with a Tekscan pressure sensor and performed each trial at 25\%, 50\%, and 100\% maximum voluntary exertion. A relationship was found between increasing exertion and increasing hand area with increasing hand contact area. The force distribution maps showed the thenar region of the hand exerts the most force during pushing while the metacarpal joint line exerts the highest force during pulling. The third and fourth phalange were found to exert the highest phalange force during gripping. The force distribution maps from the RA subject showed higher thumb forces and distal phalange forces, relative to the entire phalange, compared to the non-impaired subjects. This suggests that the RA subject compensates for the lack of phalange function with the regions of the hand that still function. Future studies should sample individuals with a larger hand area range and sample more individuals with RA.},

The subjects were 15 elderly males (mean age 65.6 ± 2.5 years, mean height 165.7 ± 6.0. cm, mean mass 63.9 ± 5.5. kg) and 15 elderly females (mean age 65.0 ± 2.6 years, mean height 155.2 ± 5.3. cm, mean mass 56.5 ± 7.3. kg). Peak velocity was measured by the dominant hand with loads of 30, 40 and 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The MVC was significantly greater in males than in females. The peak velocity and the required time to reach peak velocity in all loads showed insignificant differences between both groups. Hand grip power was significantly greater in males than in females in all loads. In conclusion, elderly males have superior hand grip power compared to elderly females and this gender difference depends largely on MVC. The decrease in muscle contraction velocity in those main muscle groups related to hand grip movement accompanied by age may be greater in males than in females. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The purpose of the study was to evaluate grip force control in individuals with hand OA during the lifting of an object. The study design used was a case-control study. Ten females with hand OA and a group of age-matched females performed two functional tasks: lifting an instrumented object vertically while the load was suddenly changed and lifting and placing the object on a shelf. Load Force Peak, Grip force at liftoff, Grip Force Peak, Time Lag, and Latency were measured and analyzed. Individuals with hand OA were able to modulate the magnitude and temporal parameters of grip force; however, they applied higher grip forces (at liftoff [p = 0.002]; Grip Force Peak [p = 0.039]) and demonstrated a longer Latency (p = 0.015) to manipulate the instrumented object when compared with the control subjects. The Load Force Peak and Time Lag were not significantly different between the two groups. Detailed information about how individuals with hand OA perform prehension activities of daily living will help to better understand the limitations of grip force control in these individuals. © 2011 Hanley \& Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the predictive value of hand grip/body weight ratio and hand grip strength in early adulthood for obtaining a disability pension (DP) due to musculoskeletal disorders in later life. METHODS: A nationwide population-based sample of men born 1951-76 (n=1,387,166) in Sweden and anthropometric and strength indicators from their conscription examination. Register data on the date and diagnoses of granted DP between the years 1971-2006. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). RESULTS: The lowest quintile of hand grip/body weight ratio predicted a greatly increased risk (HR 2.51, 95\% CI 2.40-2.63) for DP due to musculoskeletal disorders compared to the mid-quintile. The highest quintile of hand grip/body weight ratio predicted a decreased risk (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.75-0.84). Stratification of the hand grip/body weight ratio with body mass index confirmed the results. However, the highest quintiles of hand grip strength adjusted for height and weight predicted a somewhat increased risk for DP due to musculoskeletal disorders (HR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.18-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the hand grip/body weight ratio in young adulthood is strongly and inversely associated with men's risk of obtaining a disability pension due to musculoskeletal disorders in later life. However, the risk seems to be mediated through the body weight. The properties of hand grip/body weight ratio should be further evaluated before it can be recommended for use in clinical and epidemiological studies},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) in assessing nutritional, physical and psychosocial functions in community-living elderly individuals. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of elderly individuals investigated in August 2007 and August-September 2008. Nutritional status was assessed using serum biomarkers, anthropometric measurements and the MNA. Physical function was assessed by measuring grip strength and both usual and maximum walking speeds. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to measure the individual's depressive state. SETTING: Elder-care facilities in Tokyo, Japan. SUBJECTS: Community-living elderly individuals aged ≥65 years (n 130). RESULTS: The MNA evaluation classified twenty-seven (20·8 \%) individuals as being at risk for malnutrition (MNA score ≤23·5); these at-risk individuals included a high proportion of the elderly aged ≥75 years. MNA scores correlated with nutritional biomarkers (total protein, albumin, cholinesterase, Hb) and anthropometric measurements (triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, mid-arm muscle area) and exhibited a strong correlation with grip strength and GDS score. Multivariate analysis revealed that grip strength, GDS score, marital status and maximum walking speed are strong predictors of MNA score. CONCLUSIONS: The MNA is considerably useful in providing a comprehensive assessment of nutritional status in elderly, community-living Japanese. However, larger-scale epidemiological studies are needed to determine the utility and the appropriate cut-off point of the MNA as a screen for risk of malnutrition.},

abstract = {Purpose: Reliable electromyographic evaluation of the shoulder in common painful conditions is a major challenge due to a reduced range of movement and pain-related muscle inhibition. This study investigates the use of a hand grip task for the assessment of shoulder muscle activation. Methods: Muscle activity and fatigue for supraspisnatus and infraspinatus muscles were measured in 16 healthy controls using fine-wire electrodes during a controlled gripping task at 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction, in a standardized sitting and arm position. Changes in muscle activity and fatigue were measured by the time-slope of root mean square amplitude and median frequency, respectively. Results: A significant positive amplitude slope (p< 0.01) was found for both supraspinatus and infraspinatus, indicating that the task resulted in increasing muscle activity. Judging by the median frequency slope, there was no sign of fatigue progression. Conclusion: A standardized hand grip task in a neutral position activates key rotator cuff muscles. This might provide a method for electromyographic assessment of shoulder girdle muscles which avoids problems due to pain-related limitation of movement, and might be useful in the development and monitoring of shoulder rehabilitation strategies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rapid balance reactions such as compensatory reach to grasp represent important response strategies following unexpected loss of balance. While it has been assumed that early corrective actions arise from subcortical networks, recent research has prompted speculation about the potential role of cortical involvement. With reach to grasp reactions there is evidence of parallels in the control of perturbation-evoked reaching versus rapid voluntary reaching. However, the potential role of cortical involvement in such rapid balance reactions remains speculative. To test if cortical motor regions are involved we used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to temporarily suppress the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) in participants involved in two reaching conditions: (1) rapid compensatory perturbation-evoked reach to grasp and (2) voluntary reach to grasp in response to an auditory cue. We hypothesized that following cTBS to the left M1 hand area we would find diminished EMG responses in the reaching (right) hand for both compensatory and voluntary movements. To isolate balance reactions to the upper limb participants were seated in an elevated tilt-chair with a stable handle positioned in front of their right shoulder. The chair was held vertical by a magnet and triggered to fall backward randomly. To regain balance, participants were instructed to reach for the handle as quickly as possible with the right hand upon chair release. Intermixed with perturbation trials, participants were also required to reach for the same handle but in response to an auditory tone. Muscle activity was recorded from several muscles of the right arm/hand using electromyography. As expected, movement time and muscle onsets were much faster following perturbation versus auditory-cued reaching. The novel finding from our study was the reduced amplitude of hand muscle activity post-cTBS for both perturbation-cued and auditory-cued reaches. Moreover, this reduction was specific to the cTBS-targeted hand with no effect on remaining arm muscles. These findings support the idea that cortical networks contribute to both volitional and perturbation-evoked reaches and provide evidence for M1involvement in driving early arm responses toward a target following sudden loss of balance. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The North West Adelaide Health Study is a representative longitudinal cohort study of people originally aged 18 years and over. The aim of this study was to describe normative data for hand grip strength in a community-based Australian population. Secondary aims were to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hand grip strength, and to compare Australian data with international hand grip strength norms. Methods: The sample was randomly selected and recruited by telephone interview. Overall, 3 206 (81\% of those recruited) participants returned to the clinic during the second stage (2004-2006) which specifically focused on the collection of information relating to musculoskeletal conditions. Results: Following the exclusion of 435 participants who had hand pain and/or arthritis, 1366 men and 1312 women participants provided hand grip strength measurement. The study population was relatively young, with 41.5\% under 40 years; and their mean BMI was 28.1 kg/m2 (SD 5.5). Higher hand grip strength was weakly related to higher BMI in adults under the age of 30 and over the age of 70, but inversely related to higher BMI between these ages. Australian norms from this sample had amongst the lowest of the hand grip strength of the internationally published norms, except those from underweight populations. Conclusions: This population demonstrated higher BMI and lower grip strength in younger participants than much of the international published, population data. A complete exploration of the relationship between BMI and hand grip strength was not fully explored as there were very few participants with BMI in the underweight range. The age and gender grip strength values are lower in younger adults than those reported in international literature.},

abstract = {This study aimed to clarify the difference in hand grip power in elderly males and females. The subjects were 15 elderly males (mean age 65.6 ± 2.5 years, mean height 165.7 ± 6.0. cm, mean mass 63.9 ± 5.5. kg) and 15 elderly females (mean age 65.0 ± 2.6 years, mean height 155.2 ± 5.3. cm, mean mass 56.5 ± 7.3. kg). Peak velocity was measured by the dominant hand with loads of 30, 40 and 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The MVC was significantly greater in males than in females. The peak velocity and the required time to reach peak velocity in all loads showed insignificant differences between both groups. Hand grip power was significantly greater in males than in females in all loads. In conclusion, elderly males have superior hand grip power compared to elderly females and this gender difference depends largely on MVC. The decrease in muscle contraction velocity in those main muscle groups related to hand grip movement accompanied by age may be greater in males than in females. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {This study examined the effect of friction between the hand and grip surface on a person's grip strategy and force generation capacity. Twelve young healthy adults performed power grip exertions on an instrumented vertical cylinder with the maximum and 50\% of maximum efforts (far above the grip force required to hold the cylinder), while normal and shear forces at each phalanx of all five fingers in the direction orthogonal to the gravity were recorded. The cylinder surface was varied for high-friction rubber and low-friction paper coverings. An increase in surface friction by replacing the paper covering with the rubber covering resulted in 4\% greater mean phalanx normal force (perpendicular to the cylinder surface) and 22\% greater mean phalanx shear force in either the proximal or distal direction of the digits (p<0.05; for both 50\% and maximum grip efforts). Consequently, increased friction with the rubber surface compared to the paper surface was associated with a 20\% increase in the angular deviation of the phalanx force from the direction normal to the cylinder surface (p<0.05). This study demonstrates that people significantly changed the magnitude and direction of phalanx forces depending on the surface they gripped. Such change in the grip strategy appears to help increase grip force generation capacity. This finding suggests that a seemingly simple power grip exertion involves sensory feedback-based motor control, and that people's power grip capacity may be reduced in cases of numbness, glove use, or injuries resulting in reduced sensation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction: Malunion following open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fracture threatens wrist function. Fixed-angle palmar plates provide rigid fixation that is stable over time; however, the pronator quadratus sectioning required by the anterior approach entails a risk of pronation strength loss and of distal radioulnar joint destabilization. The present study assessed recovery of grip, pronation and supination strength following such internal fixation. Patients and method: A prospective study included 26 distal radial fractures with dorsal displacement, osteosynthesized using a fixed-angle palmar plate, in 25 patients (mean age: 47.5. years; range: 17-72. years). Assessment concerned the classical parameters, plus grip and pronosupination strength recovery. Results: At a mean 14. months follow-up (range: 6-30. months), patients had recovered 91\% grip strength, 88\% pronation strength and 85\% supination strength with respect to the healthy side. Complications comprised three cases of malunion, two of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, and four of post-traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome. Discussion: A study of the literature found 75-95\% grip strength recovery following osteosynthesis using fixed-angle plates. Few studies, however, have focused on pronosupination strength, and none reported its evolution following osteosynthesis. Conclusion: The present study found no drawbacks associated with a technique which usually involves sectioning the pronator quadratus. Except in case of malunion or joint stiffness, fixed-angle palmar plate osteosynthesis was followed by recovery of grip and pronosupination strength. Level of evidence: Level IV: prospective non-randomized, non-comparative observational study. ?? 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Anticipatory grip force adjustments are a prime example of the predictive nature of motor control. An object held in precision grip is stabilized by fine adjustments of the grip force against changes in tangential load force arising from inertia during acceleration and deceleration. When an object is subject to sudden impact loads, prediction becomes critical as the time available for sensory feedback is very short. Here, we investigated the control of grip force when participants performed a targeted tapping task with a hand-held object. During the initial transport phase of the movement, load force varied smoothly with acceleration. In contrast, in the collision, load forces sharply increased to very large values. In the transport phase, grip force and load force were coupled in phase, as expected. However, in the collision, grip force did not parallel load force. Rather, it exhibited a stereotyped profile with maximum \~{}65 ms after peak load at contact. By using catch trials and a virtual environment, we demonstrate that this peak of grip force is pre-programmed. This observation is validated across experimental manipulations involving different target stiffness and directions of movement. We suggest that the central nervous system optimizes stability in object manipulation-as in catching-by regulating mechanical parameters including stiffness and damping through grip force. This study provides novel insights about how the brain coordinates grip force in manipulation involving an object interacting with the environment. © 2011 IBRO.},

The grip forces between dominant and non-dominant hands at low CR-10 levels were negligible. The grip forces were significantly different between the two hands at level 10. Similar results were found for the postural conditions. A follow-up experiment was conducted to estimate the subjective rating when applying a pre-determined grip force under the same conditions.

abstract = {It has been suggested that athletes with longer fingers and larger hand surfaces enjoy stronger grip power. Therefore, some researchers have examined a number of factors and anthropometric variables that explain this issue. To our knowledge, the data is scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hand dimensions, hand shape and some anthropometric characteristics on handgrip strength in male grip athletes and non-athletes. 80 subjects aged between 19 and 29 participated in this study in two groups including: national and collegian grip athletes (n=40), and non-athletes (n=40). Body height and mass were measured to calculate body mass index. The shape of the dominant hand was drawn on a piece of paper with a thin marker so that finger spans, finger lengths, and perimeters of the hand could be measured. The hand shape was estimated as the ratio of the hand width to hand length. Handgrip strength was measured in the dominant and non-dominant hand using a standard dynamometer. Descriptive statistics were used for each variable and independent t test was used to analyze the differences between the two groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient test was used to evaluate the correlation between studied variables. Also, to predict important variables in handgrip strength, the linear trend was assessed using a linear regression analysis. There was a significant difference between the two groups in absolute handgrip strength (p<0.001) and handgrip/height ratio (p<0.001). The indices of body height, body mass, lean body mass and body fat content (p<0.001) were significantly greater in grip athletes. All hand variables except FS1-4 (p>0.05) were significantly different between the groups (p<0.001). After controlling body mass all hand anthropometric characteristics except thumb length (r=0.240, p= 0.135), hand shape (r=-0.029, p=0.858), middle finger length (r=0.305, p=0.056) and forearm circumference (r=0.162, p=0.319) significantly correlated with handgrip strength in grip athletes, but not in non-athletes, except for forearm circumference (r=0.406, p=0.010). The results showed that handgrip strength and some of the hand dimensions may be different in athletes who have handgrip movements with an object or opponent in comparison to non-athletes. Also, there was a significant positive correlation between handgrip strength and most of the hand dimensions in grip athletes. Therefore, these can be used in talent identification in handgrip-related sports and in clinical settings as well.},

abstract = {The force applied upon a vertically oriented hand-held object could be decomposed into two orthogonal and highly coordinated components: the grip force (GF; the component perpendicular to the hand-object contact area that provides friction) and the load force (LF; the parallel component that can move the object or support the body). The aim of this study was to investigate the underexplored effects of task instruction and hand dominance on GF-LF coordination. Sixteen right-handed subjects performed bimanual manipulation against a horizontally oriented instrumented device under different sets of instructions. The tasks involved exertion of ramp-and-hold or oscillation patterns of LF performed symmetrically with two hands, while the instructions regarding individual actions were either similar (pull with both hands) or dissimilar (pull with one hand and hold with another). The results revealed that the instruction " to pull" leads to higher indices of GF-LF coordination than the instruction " to hold" , as evidenced by a lower GF-LF ratio, higher GF-LF coupling, and higher GF modulation. The only effect of hand dominance was a moderate time lag of GF relative to LF changes observed in the non-dominant hand. We conclude that the instructions could play an important role in GF-LF coordination and, therefore, they should be taken into account when exploring or routinely testing hand function. Additionally, the results suggest that the neural control of GF of the non-dominant hand could involve some feedback mechanisms. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Undernutrition is common among tuberculosis (TB) patients. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of multi-micronutrient supplementation during TB treatment on weight, body composition, and handgrip strength. A total of 865 patients with smear-positive (PTB+) or -negative (PTB-) pulmonary TB were randomly allocated to receive a daily biscuit with or without multi-micronutrients for 60 d during the intensive phase of TB treatment. Weight, arm fat area, arm muscle area, and handgrip strength were assessed at baseline and after 2 and 5 mo. At 2 mo, the multi-micronutrient supplementation led to a higher handgrip gain (1.22 kg; 95\% CI = 0.50, 1.94; P = 0.001) but had no effects on other outcomes. The effects of multi-micronutrient supplementation were modified by HIV infection (P-interaction = 0.002). Among HIV- patients, multi-micronutrient supplementation increased weight gain by 590 g (95\% CI = -40, 1210; P = 0.07) and handgrip strength by 1.6 kg (95\% CI = 0.78, 2.47; P < 0.001), whereas among HIV+ patients, it reduced weight gain by 1440 g (95\% CI = 290, 2590; P = 0.002) and had no effect on handgrip strength (0.07 kg; 95\% CI = -1.30, 1.46; P = 0.91). The reduced weight gain among HIV+ patients receiving multi-micronutrient supplementation seemed to be explained by a higher proportion of patients reporting fever. At 5 mo, the effects on weight were sustained, whereas there was no effect on handgrip strength. In conclusion, multi-micronutrient supplementation given as a biscuit is beneficial among HIV- PTB patients and may be recommended to TB programs. More research is needed to develop an effective supplement for HIV+ PTB patients.},

abstract = {Background \& aims: Among all muscle function tests, measurement of hand grip strength has gained attention as a simple, non-invasive marker of muscle strength of upper extremities, well suitable for clinical use. This review outlines the prognostic relevance of grip strength in various clinical and epidemiologic settings and investigates its suitability as marker of nutritional status in cross-sectional as well as intervention studies. Methods: Studies investigating grip strength as prognostic marker or nutritional parameter in cross-sectional or intervention studies were summarized. Results and conclusions: Numerous clinical and epidemiological studies have shown the predictive potential of hand grip strength regarding short and long-term mortality and morbidity. In patients, impaired grip strength is an indicator of increased postoperative complications, increased length of hospitalization, higher rehospitalisation rate and decreased physical status. In elderly in particular, loss of grip strength implies loss of independence. Epidemiological studies have moreover demonstrated that low grip strength in healthy adults predicts increased risk of functional limitations and disability in higher age as well as all-cause mortality.As muscle function reacts early to nutritional deprivation, hand grip strength has also become a popular marker of nutritional status and is increasingly being employed as outcome variable in nutritional intervention studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract = {Background: Sexual behavioural change is essential to prevent HIV infections in Africa and statistical analysis of risk factors at the individual-level may be used to design interventions. The importance of reducing cross-generational sex (young women having sex with older men) and delaying age at first sex on the spread of HIV at the population-level has been presumed but not scientifically investigated and quantified. Methods: A mathematical model of heterosexual spread of HIV was developed to predict the population-level impact of reducing cross-generational sex and delaying sexual debut. Results: The impact of behaviour change on the spread of HIV is sensitive to the structure and reaction of the sexual network. Reducing cross-generational sex could have little impact on the risk of infection unless it is accompanied by a reduction in the number of risky sexual contacts. Even peer-to-peer sexual mixing can support high endemic levels of HIV. The benefit of delaying sexual debut is comparatively small and is reduced if males continue to prefer young partners or if young women spend more time unmarried. In Manicaland, Zimbabwe, if older men were to use condoms as frequently as young men, the reduction in risk of infection could exceed that generated by a two-year delay in first sex. Conclusions: At the individual-level avoiding sex with older partners and delaying sexual debut can decrease the risk of infection but at the population-level these interventions may do little to limit the spread of HIV without wider-ranging behavioural changes throughout the sexual network.},

abstract = {A fundamental principle that has emerged from studies of natural gaze behavior is that goal-directed arm movements are typically guided by a saccade to the target. In this study, we evaluated a hypothesis that this principle does not apply to rapid reach-to-grasp movements evoked by sudden unexpected balance perturbations. These perturbations involved forward translation of a large (2 ?? 6 m) motion platform configured to simulate a " real-life" environment. Subjects performed a common " daily-life" visuo-cognitive task (find a telephone and make a call) that required walking to the end of the platform, which was triggered to move as they approached a handrail mounted alongside the travel path. A deception was used to ensure that the perturbation was truly unexpected. Eleven of 18 healthy young-adult subjects (age 22-30) reached to grasp or touch the rail in response to the balance perturbation. In support of the hypothesis, none of these arm reactions was guided by concurrent visual fixation of the handrail. Seven of the 11 looked at the rail upon first entering the environment, and hence may have used " stored" central-field information about the handrail location to guide the subsequent arm reaction. However, the other four subjects never looked directly at the rail, indicating a complete reliance on peripheral vision. These findings add to previous evidence of distinctions in the CNS control of volitional and perturbation-evoked arm movements. Future studies will determine whether similar visuo-motor behavior occurs when the available handhold is smaller or when subjects are not engaged in a concurrent visuo-cognitive task. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Myostatin, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, may modulate grip strength, an indicator of muscle function. Its serum levels could be modulated by maintenance haemodialysis (MHD).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS: Forty-one normal controls and 60 MHD patients using different dialyzers at a medical centre.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS: The grip strength of the dominant hand, body composition, and the predialysis and postdialysis serum myostatin and IGF-1 levels were measured.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The MHD patients had lower body mass index, IGF-1 level, and grip strength than the normal controls. The patients using the high-flux dialyzer had better grip strength than those using the low-flux dialyzer (25·5 vs 19·2 kg). The predialysis myostatin level was higher in low-flux dialyzer than high-flux dialyzer (31·0 vs 18·5 $\mu$g/ml). Interestingly, the high-flux dialyzer reduced the serum myostatin by 36\%, whereas low-flux dialyzer increased it by 25\%. The myostatin was inversely related to age and the use of high-flux dialyzer. Furthermore, the grip strength was negatively related to age, female gender, muscle mass, myostatin levels and haemodialysis, but positively to the use of high-flux dialyzer in linear regression. The risk of low grip strength was 7·6 times higher in those with higher serum myostatin with the adjustment of age, gender, muscle mass, haemodialysis and mode of dialysis in a logistic regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The mode of dialyzer modulates the blood levels of myostatin. Higher myostatin is associated with lower muscle function. The use of myostatin assay in various clinical settings merits further investigation.},

abstract = {The adverse effects of botulinum LL toxin and neurotoxin produced by subtype A1(A1LL and A1NTX) are becoming issues, as the toxins could diffuse from the toxin-treated ( ipsilateral) to contralateral muscles. We have attempted to produce neurotoxin from subtype A2 (A2NTX) with an amino acid sequence different from that of neurotoxin subtype A1. We measured the grip strength on the contralateral foreleg as an indicator of toxin spread from the ipsilateral to contralateral muscles. Doses of 0.30 log U or above of A1LL and A1NTX reduced the contralateral grip strength, whereas a dose of 0.78 log U of A2NTX was required to do so. We investigated the route of toxin spread using denervated, colchicine-treated, and antitoxin-treated rats. A1LL was transported via axons at doses higher than 0.30 log U and via both axons and body fluid at about 0.80 log U or a higher dose. Interestingly, A2NTX was transported via body fluid at about 0.80 log U or a higher dose, but not via axons to the contralateral side. It was concluded that A1LL and A1NTX decreased the grip strength of the toxin-untreated foreleg via both axonal transport and body fluids, while A2NTX was only transported via the body fluid},

abstract = {With continued research on brain machine interfaces (BMIs), it is now possible to control prosthetic arm position in space to a high degree of accuracy. However, a reliable decoder to infer the dexterous movements of fingers from brain activity during a natural grasping motion is still to be demonstrated. Here, we present a methodology to accurately predict and reconstruct natural hand kinematics from non-invasively recorded scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals during object grasping movements. The high performance of our decoder is attributed to a combination of the correct input space (time-domain amplitude modulation of delta-band smoothed EEG signals) and an optimal subset of EEG electrodes selected using a genetic algorithm. Trajectories of the joint angles were reconstructed for metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joints of the fingers as well as the carpo-metacarpal (CMC) and MCP joints of the thumb. High decoding accuracy (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r) between the predicted and observed trajectories (r \&\#x003D; 0.76\&\#x002B;0.01; averaged across joints) indicate that this technique may be suitable for use with a closed-loop real-time BMI to control grasping motion in prosthetics with high degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the first successful decoding of hand pre-shaping kinematics from noninvasive neural signals.},

abstract = {Low birth weight has been associated with reduced hand grip strength, which is a marker of future physical function and disease risk. The aim of this study was to apply a twin pair approach, using both 'individual' data and 'within-pair' differences, to investigate the influence of birth weight on hand grip strength and whether this association may be mediated through fat free mass (FFM). Participants from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey were included if born without congenital abnormalities, birth weight >500 g and ≥22 weeks of gestation. Follow up in adulthood (age: 18-34 year), included anthropometric measures and hand grip (n = 783 individuals, n = 326 same-sex twin pairs). Birth weight was positively associated with hand grip strength ($\beta$ = 2.60 kg, 95\% CI 1.52, 3.67, p<0.001) and FFM ($\beta$ = 4.2, 95\% CI 3.16, 5.24, p<0.001), adjusted for gestational age, sex and adult age. Using 'within-pair' analyses, the birth weight hand grip association was significant in DZ men only ($\beta$ = 5.82, 95\% CI 0.67, 10.97, p = 0.028), which was attenuated following adjustment for FFM. Within-pair birth weight FFM associations were most pronounced in DZ men ($\beta$ = 11.20, 95\% CI 7.18, 15.22, p<0.001). Our 'individual' analyses show that higher birth weight is associated with greater adult hand grip strength, which is mediated through greater adult FFM. The 'within-pair' analyses confirm this observation and furthermore show that, particularly in men, genetic factors may in part explain this association, as birth weight differences in DZ men result in greater differences in adult strength and FFM.},

abstract = {The reduction of muscle mass in the elderly is widely studied as one of the most important landmark of human aging. This process, which occurs for the decay of the correct energetic and protein metabolism, has important functional consequences on individual functionality but also on metabolic adaptation and immunological response to environmental challenges. Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene is expressed in skeletal muscle where it regulates fatty acid metabolism, redox state, and ROS formation. Considering the importance of these processes in aging, we studied two variants of the UCP3 gene in a large, aged (age range 65-105) population of southern Italy verifying if these variants were correlated to hand grip strength, the most reliable measure of muscle decay. We found that a previously described functional polymorphism, rs1800849, located in the promoter region of the UCP3 gene, has a significant impact on hand grip strength. In fact, the carriers of rs1800849 T allele showed higher hand grip than the remaining of the population. Since this allele has been reported to promote a higher expression of the gene, we conclude that a more efficient uncoupling process has a beneficial effect on the aging muscle by slowing down its age related decay.},

abstract = {During the "rubber hand illusion" (RHI) participants feel touch originating from an artificial hand, which is felt to belong to the own body. The perceived location of the real hand is shifted towards the location of the artificial hand. However, evidence as to whether the RHI is accompanied by alterations of hand action is mixed. We found that the perceived size of one's own hand was affected by the size of the artificial hand that was used to elicit the illusion. Moreover, we tested a possible transfer of the RHI to a reach-to-grasp action. We observed that hand transport (i.e., reach) errors after RHI induction were independent of artificial hand size, showing that the parameter which is important for these reaching errors is the hand's perceived location. Results thus show that the RHI affects not only perceptual, but also action processing. In contrast, grip aperture was affected by artificial hand size independent of the RHI, suggesting that visual information about hand size affects grasping independent of embodiment of the artificial hand. Grip size increased with artificial hand size; this effect is explained by a higher reliance on proprioceptive information during blind reaching after receiving distorted visual information. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Taking inspiration from neurophysiological studies on synergies in the human grasping action, this paper tries to demonstrate that it is possible to find a general rule for performing a stable, human-like cylindrical grasp with a robotic hand. To this purpose, the theoretical formulation and the experimental validation of a reach-and-grasp algorithm for determining the optimal hand position and the optimal finger configuration for grasping a cylindrical object with known features are presented. The proposed algorithm is based on the minimization of an objective function expressed by the sum of the distances of the hand joints from the object surface. Algorithm effectiveness has preliminarily been tested by means of simulation trials. Experimental trials on a real arm-hand robotic system have then been carried out in order to validate the approach and evaluate algorithm performance.},

abstract = {The Jamar dynamometer has been widely used in various chronic illnesses and has demonstrated its strength as a potential prognostic indicator. Various stratified normative values have been published using different methodologies, leading to conflicting results. No study used statistical techniques considering the non-Gaussian distribution of the obtained grip strength (GS) values. Jamar GS was assessed in 720 healthy participants, subdivided into seven age decade groups consisting of at least 50 men and 50 women each. Normative values (median and fifth values) were calculated using quantile regressions with restricted cubic spline functions on age. Possible confounding personal factors (hand dominance, length, weight, hobby, and job categorization) were examined. Clinically applicable revised normative values for the Jamar dynamometer, stratified for age and gender, are presented. Hand dominance had no influence. Other personal factors only minimally influenced final values. This study provides revised normative GS values for the Jamar dynamometer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hand strength is an important independent surrogate parameter to assess outcome and risk of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the predictive power of cofactors and to predict population-based normative grip and pinch strength. METHODS: A representative population survey was used as the basis for prediction analyses (n = 978). Bivariate relationships between grip/pinch strengths of the dominate hand were explored by means of all relevant mathematical functions to maximize prediction. The resulting best functions were combined into a multivariate regression. RESULTS: Polynoms (up to the third degree) were the best predictive functions. On the bivariate level, height was best correlated to grip (46.2\% explained variance) and pinch strength (37.7\% explained variance) in a linear relationship, followed by sex, age, weight, and occupational demand on the hand. Multivariate regression provided predicted values close to the empirical ones explaining 76.6\% of the variance for grip strength and 67.7\% for pinch strength. CONCLUSION: The five easy-to-measure cofactors sex, age, body height, categorized occupational demand on the hand, and body weight provide a highly accurate prediction of normative grip and pinch strength.},

Eighty-two undergraduates were randomized to control (n = 26), na\"{\i}ve simulator (n = 28), and coached simulator (n = 28) conditions. Outcome measures included grip strength in kilograms, variables calculated from grip strength force curves, and the Word Memory Test (WMT). While average force in kilograms was not significantly different between groups, significant differences were found on the average to peak force ratio as calculated from grip strength force curves. The classification accuracy of average to peak force ratio was lower than the WMT, but comparable to other effort measures. Force curve analysis may warrant further study in a clinical sample.},

abstract = {Grip strength dynamometers often are used to assess hand function in children. The use of normative grip strength data at followup is difficult because of the influence of growth and neuromuscular maturation. As an alternative, infant welfare centers throughout the world use growth diagrams to observe normative growth. The aim of this study was to develop similar growth diagrams for grip strength in children. We measured the grip strength, hand dominance, gender, height, and weight of 225 children, 4 to 12 years old. We developed separate statistical models for both hands of boys and girls for drawing growth curves. Grip strength increased with age for both hands. For the whole group, the dominant hand produced higher grip strength than the nondominant hand and boys were stronger than girls. The grip strength of boys and girls differed between 2 and 19 N for the different age groups. Because grip strength measurements are accompanied by a rather large variance, the growth diagrams (presenting a continuum in grip strength) make it possible to better observe grip strength development with time corresponding to a more exact age. Depending on the accuracy needed, the use of one combined diagram could be considered. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.},

The subjects used a pinch grip to grasp and restrain an instrumented handle from moving when it was subject to unpredictable load forces of different rates (2, 4, 8, 32 N/s) or amplitudes (1, 2, 4 N). The hand ipsilateral to the lesion of the cerebellar subjects showed delayed and more variable response latencies, e.g., 278 +/- 162 ms for loads delivered at 2 N/s, compared to HS 180 +/- 53 ms (P = 0.005). The CL also used a higher pre-load grip force with the ipsilateral hand, 1.6 +/- 0.8 N, than the HS, 1.3 +/- 0.6 N (P = 0.017). In addition, the contralateral hand in subjects with unilateral cerebellar stroke showed a delayed onset of the grip response compared to HS. Cerebellar lesions thus impair the reactive grip control both in the ipsilateral and contralateral hand.},

abstract = {Manual dexterity, a prerogative of primates, is under the control of the corticospinal (CS) tract. Because 90-95\% of CS axons decussate, it is assumed that this control is exerted essentially on the contralateral hand. Consistently, unilateral lesion of the hand representation in the motor cortex is followed by a complete loss of dexterity of the contralesional hand. During the months following lesion, spontaneous recovery of manual dexterity takes place to a highly variable extent across subjects, although largely incomplete. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that after a significant postlesion period, manual performance in the ipsilesional hand is correlated with the extent of functional recovery in the contralesional hand. To this aim, ten adult macaque monkeys were subjected to permanent unilateral motor cortex lesion. Monkeys' manual performance was assessed for each hand during several months postlesion, using our standard behavioral test (modified Brinkman board task) that provides a quantitative measure of reach and grasp ability. The ipsilesional hand's performance was found to be significantly enhanced over the long term (100-300 days postlesion) in six of ten monkeys, with the six exhibiting the best, though incomplete, recovery of the contralesional hand. There was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.932; P < 0.001) between performance in the ipsilesional hand after significant postlesion period and the extent of recovery of the contralesional hand. This observation is interpreted in terms of different possible mechanisms of recovery, dependent on the recruitment of motor areas in the lesioned and/or intact hemispheres.},

abstract = {Reaching out to pick up an object seems a trivial matter, but selecting the appropriate hand configuration requires a series of complex computations that process the object's dimensions, orientation and environment. A current debate in motor control concerns how and when the motor system responds to unexpected changes in the visual and spatial properties of objects to be grasped. In the current experiment, visual manipulations that increased either target size, distractor proximity or hand size were applied gradually and continuously throughout reach to grasp movements. All manipulations were associated with early and continuous modifications of the grasping component, but only an increase in hand size affected transport characteristics. This suggests that visual information of both the object and the effector are continuously processed in movement computations, in keeping with models of motor control that posit high weighting for online sensory feedback. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the variance in radius bone strength indices explained by forearm muscle cross sectional area (MCSA) and isometric (ISO), concentric (CON), or eccentric (ECC) grip torque in healthy men and postmenopausal women when gender and body size were controlled for. Additionally we assessed variance in various grip contractions explained by MCSA. METHODS: pQCT estimated bone strength of the radius and forearm MCSA were measured from 45 healthy adults (59.4-/+7.2 yrs). Isokinetic dynamometry was used to assess peak grip torque. Regressions were adjusted for gender and radius length. RESULTS: Peak grip torques were not independent predictors (p>0.05) of distal radius bone strength in compression (bone strength index; BSI(c)) when gender was included in the prediction model. Gender was not a contributor to any model that included MCSA (p>0.05). At the diaphysis all torque measures, MCSA, gender, and length, significantly contributed to predict similar portions (79-80\%) of the stress strain index (SSI(p); strength in torsion). MCSA accounted for 68-76\% of variance in grip torque (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: When estimating radius bone strength, forearm MCSA is a comparable predictor to CON, ISO, and ECC grip torques and is also a good surrogate of these contraction types.},

Cyclic functional electrical stimulation does not enhance gains in hand grasp function when used as an adjunct to onabotulinumtoxinA and task practice therapy: a single-blind, randomized controlled pilot study. Objective: To determine whether onabotulinumtoxinA injections and task practice training with or without functional electrical stimulation (FES) improve upper limb motor function in chronic spastic hemiparesis. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient spasticity clinic. Participants: Participants (N=23) had chronic spastic hemiparesis with moderate-severe hand impairment based on Chedoke-McMaster Assessment greater than or equal to 2. Interventions: OnabotulinumtoxinA injections followed by 12 weeks of postinjection task practice. Participants randomly assigned to FES group were also fitted with an orthosis that provided FES. Main Outcome Measures: Motor Activity Log (MAL)-Observation was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and MAL-Self-Report. Results: For the entire cohort, MAL-Observation mean item scores improved significantly from baseline to week 6 (P=.005) but did not remain significant at week 12. MAL-Self-Report mean item scores improved significantly (P=.009) from baseline to week 6 and remained significantly higher (P=.014) at week 12. ARAT total scores also improved significantly from baseline to week 6 (P=.018) and were sustained at week 12 (P=.032). However, there were no significant differences between the FES and no-FES groups for any outcome variable over time. Conclusions: Rehabilitation strategies that combine onabotulinumtoxinA injections and task practice therapy are feasible and effective in improving upper-limb motor function and reducing spasticity in patients with chronic spastic hemiparesis. However, the cyclic FES protocol used in this study did not increase gains achieved with the combination of onabotulinumtoxinA and task practice alone. ?? 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

Design: Single group, repeated measures study. Setting: Clinical sports medicine laboratory at a university hospital. Participants: Twenty-one healthy collegiate athletes voluntarily participated in this study. All subjects were male (average height: 181.24 ?? 7.60 cm; average body weight: 72.86 ?? 7.03 kg; average age: 20.86 ?? 2.59 years). Main Outcome Measures: First, maximal grip strength of the dominant hand was assessed by hand-held dynamometer. Then, 50\% of maximal grip strength was established as the reference value of force sense. Absolute and related force sense errors and maximal grip strength were measured under three conditions: (1) without taping; (2) with placebo taping; and (3) with Kinesio taping. Results: Results revealed no significant differences in maximal grip strength between the three conditions (p = 0.936). Both related and absolute force sense errors in grip strength measurements significantly increased the accuracy of the results under the three conditions (related force sense errors: p < 0.05; absolute force sense errors: p < 0.05).

abstract = {Fetal development may permanently affect muscle function. Indian newborns have a low mean birthweight, predominantly due to low lean tissue and muscle mass. We aimed to examine the relationship of birthweight, and arm muscle area (AMA) at birth and post-natal growth to hand-grip strength in Indian children. Grip strength was measured in 574 children aged 9 years, who had detailed anthropometry at birth and every 6-12 months post-natally. Mean (standard deviation (SD)) birthweight was 2863 (446) g. At 9 years, the children were short (mean height SD -0.6) and light (mean weight SD -1.1) compared with the World Health Organization growth reference. Mean (SD) grip strength was 12.7 (2.2) kg (boys) and 11.0 (2.0) kg (girls). Weight, length and AMA at birth, but not skinfold measurements at birth, were positively related to 9-year grip strength ($\beta$=0.40 kg per standard deviation increase in birthweight, p<0.001; and $\beta$=0.41 kg per standard deviation increase in AMA, p<0.001). Grip strength was positively related to 9-year height, body mass index and AMA and to gains in these measurements from birth to 2 years, 2-5 years and 5-9 years (p<0.001 for all). The associations between birth size and grip strength were attenuated but remained statistically significant for AMA after adjusting for 9-year size. We conclude that larger overall size and muscle mass at birth are associated with greater muscle strength in childhood, and that this is mediated mainly through greater post-natal size. Poorer muscle development in utero is associated with reduced childhood muscle strength.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between hand-grip (HG) isometric strength and isokinetic moment of the shoulder musculature in 18 healthy male volunteers. HG isometric strength at 0??, 90?? and 180?? of shoulder flexion and isokinetic peak and average concentric moments of the shoulder rotators and abductors and the elbow flexors at 60?? s-1 were measured on both the dominant and non-dominant sides. Pearson correlation coefficients revealed statistically significant positive relationships between HG isometric strength and isokinetic moments of the shoulder external rotators (r=0.40-0.54), the shoulder abductors (r=0.42-0.71) and the elbow flexors (r=0.45-0.66) regardless of hand dominance. The positive relationships between HG isometric strength and isokinetic strength of the shoulder stabilisers was probably attributed to mechanisms providing stability to the elbow and shoulder joints either by force transmission via myotendinous and myofascial pathways or by "overflow" of muscular activity via neural circuits. The results of the present findings suggested that HG isometric strength can be used to monitor isokinetic strength of certain muscle groups contributing to the stability of the shoulder joint; however, HG strength may account only for approximately 16-50\% of the variability in isokinetic strength of these muscle groups. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Study Design: Test-retest reliability study on grip strength in children. Introduction: Measuring grip strength in children is difficult because of the weight and size of the instrument, brief attention span, and possible lack of task understanding. Therefore, adaptations to the measurement protocols to improve reliability would be very important for research and clinical evaluation. Purpose: In this study, we compared the reliability of a grip strength dynamometer (Lode dynamometer, Lode BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) using three different protocols. Methods: Test-retest reliability of the American Society of Hand Therapists protocol in 104 healthy children (4-12 years) was compared with the reliability in 63 healthy children of a visual feedback protocol and a suspension protocol reducing weight of the instrument. Results: For the total group, intraclass correlation coefficients for the dominant and nondominant hands were 0.95-0.97 for all protocols, indicating that all three protocols were reliable. Conclusion: No statistically significant difference was found among the reliability of the different protocols, but the suspension protocol produced small but significantly higher force levels.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the correlations between anthropometric data and maximal grip strength (MGS) in order to establish a simple model to predict "normal" MGS. Randomized bilateral measurement of MGS was performed on a homogeneous population of 100 subjects. MGS was measured according to a standardized protocol with three dynamometers (Jamar, Myogrip and Martin Vigorimeter) for both dominant and non-dominant sides. Several anthropometric data were also measured: height; weight; hand, wrist and forearm circumference; hand and palm length. Among these data, hand circumference had the strongest correlation with MGS for all three dynamometers and for both hands (0.789 and 0.782 for Jamar; 0.829 and 0.824 for Myogrip; 0.663 and 0.730 for Vigorimeter). In addition, the only anthropometric variable systematically selected by a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was also hand circumference. Based on this parameter alone, a predictive regression model presented good results (r
                        2=0.624 for Jamar; r

abstract = {Background: Lateral epicondylitis is a common sports injury of the elbow caused due to altered muscle activation during repetitive wrist extension in many athletic and non-athletic endeavours. The amount of muscle activity and timing of contraction eventually is directly dependent upon joint position during the activity. The purpose of our study was to compare the grip strength in athletes with lateral epicondylalgia in two different wrist extension positions and compare them between involved and uninvolved sides of athletes and non-athletes. Methods: An assessor-blinded case-control study of eight athletes and twenty-two non-athletes was done. The grip strength was measured using JAMAR® hand dynamometer in kilograms-force at 15 degrees (slightly extended) and 35 degrees (moderately extended) wrist extension positions (maintained by wrist splints) on both involved and uninvolved sides of athletes and non-athletes with unilateral lateral epicondylitis of atleast 3 months duration. Their pain was to be elicited with local tenderness and two of three tests being positive- Cozen's, Mill's manoeuvre, resisted middle finger extension tests. For comparisons of grip strength, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for within-group comparison (between 15 and 35 degrees wrist extension positions) and Mann-Whitney U test was used for between-group (athletes vs. non-athletes) comparisons at 95\% confidence interval and were done using SPSS 11.5 for Windows. Results: Statistically significant greater grip strength was found in 15 degrees (27.75 ± 4.2 kgms in athletes; 16.45 ± 4.2 kgms in non-athletes) wrist extension than at 35 degrees (25.25 ± 3.53 kgm in athletes and 14.18 ± 3.53 kgm in non-athletes). The athletes had greater grip strength than non-athletes in each of test positions (11.3 kgm at 15 degrees and 11.07 kgm at 35 degrees) measured. There was also a significant difference between involved and uninvolved sides' grip strength at both wrist positions (4.44 ± .95 kgm at 15 degrees and 4.44 ± .86 kgm in 35 degrees) which was significant (p < .05) only in non-athletes. Conclusion: The grip strength was greater in 15 degrees wrist extension position and this position could then be used in athletes with lateral epicondylalgia for grip strength assessment and designing wrist splint in this population.},

abstract = {Background \& aims: Decreased functionality and muscle weakness are prominent features in cancer patients. We investigated determinants of muscle function assessed by hand grip and knee extension strength as well as functional status in cancer patients. Methods: 189 consecutively admitted cancer patients (age 60.8 ± 12.7 years, 96 male) were recruited. Muscle function was assessed by hand grip and knee extension strength, and percentage of anticipated peak expiratory flow (\%PEF). Functional status was determined by the EORTC questionnaire of quality of life. Nutritional status was assessed with Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). Age, gender, SGA, body mass index, clinical variables such as cancer location, presence of distant metastases, tumour burden according to TNM stage, UICC stage, number of drugs per day, number of comorbidities, type of treatment and depression were investigated as potential risk factors for muscle weakness and impaired functional status in a multiple regression analysis. Results: 80 patients (39 male) were classified moderately or severely malnourished. Malnutrition also emerged as an independent determinant for hand grip (estimated effect size 11\%, p < 0.01), knee extension strength (estimated effect size 12\%, p < 0.001), and peak expiratory flow (estimated effect size 30\%, p < 0.008) and functional status (estimated effect size 19.4\%, p < 0.001) next to age and gender, which were the strongest predictors. Among the disease parameters, only amount of daily medication exhibited a significant influence on knee extension strength. Conclusions: Malnutrition is a disease independent risk factor for reduced muscle strength and functional status in cancer patients. Treatment of malnutrition might therefore also restore muscle strength. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Among female dentists and teachers, we investigated the relationship of pinch grip strength with radiographic hand osteoarthritis (OA) and hand joint pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 295 female dentists and 248 female teachers aged 45-63 years for pinch grip strength using the Martin Vigorimeter. Hand radiographs were examined for the presence of OA in the wrist and each joint of the first, second, and third fingers. Joint pain and tasks with high hand loading during leisure were assessed by questionnaire. Glove size was used as proxy for hand size. RESULTS: Symptomatic hand OA (jointwise co-occurrence of radiological findings and pain) increased the risk of low pinch grip strength in both hands, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.3 (95\% CI 1.8-6.2) for the right and 2.0 (95\% CI 1.1-3.8) for the left hand, allowing for age, occupation, body mass index (BMI), hand size, and hand-loading leisure-time activity. The occurrence of findings and pain in non-corresponding joints was also associated with pinch grip strength in the right hand, but not in the left. Having only radiographic findings or pain was not associated with pinch grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the view that hand function is related to the severity of hand OA.},

abstract = {Grasping is a highly complex movement requiring coordination of a number of hand joints and muscles. In contrast to cortical descending systems, the contribution of the subcortical system for coordinating this higher degree of freedom is largely unknown. Here we explore how spinal interneurons (INs) contribute to the coordination of hand muscles by recording their activity from the cervical spinal cord (C5-T1) simultaneously with electromyographic (EMG) activity from hand and arm muscles in three monkeys performing a precision grip task. Spike-triggered averages of the rectified EMGs were compiled for 255 neurons (4821 neuron-muscle pairs). Twenty-six neurons produced 68 significant postspike effects in hand and arm muscles and were identified as premotor interneurons (PreM-INs), which presumably have relatively direct synaptic effects on spinal motoneurons. The majority of the PreM-INs (22/26 neurons) produced postspike effects in finger muscles (intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles) compared with wrist (9/26 neurons) and elbow muscles (1/26 neurons). The effects in finger muscles were mostly facilitative [postspike facilitations (PSFs), 19/22 neurons], and few had suppressive effects (postspike suppressions, 3/22 neurons). Moreover, PreM-INs produced more divergent PSFs in intrinsic hand muscles (2.5 ± 1.9 muscles/neuron) than in wrist muscles (1.2 ± 0.4 muscles/neurons). We conclude that spinal PreM-INs produce divergent facilitations preferentially in intrinsic hand muscles. These results suggest that spinal interneurons contribute to the control of hand grasping in primates by combining and coordinating multiple finger muscles.},

Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of residual muscles can reproduce the most dominant grasping tasks and can be initialized by brain signals. However, due to the very complex hand anatomy and current limitations in FES-technology with surface electrodes, these grasp patterns cannot be smoothly executed. In this paper, we present an adaptable passive hand orthosis which is capable of producing natural and smooth movements when coupled with FES. It evenly synchronizes the grasping movements and applied forces on all fingers, allowing for naturalistic gestures and functional grasps of everyday objects. The orthosis is also equipped with a lock, which allows it to remain in the desired position without the need for long-term stimulation. Furthermore, we quantify improvements offered by the orthosis compare them with natural grasps on healthy subjects.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new online single-trial EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for controlling hand holding and sequence of hand grasping and opening in an interactive virtual reality environment. The goal of this research is to develop an interaction technique that will allow the BCI to be effective in real-world scenarios for hand grasp control. One of the major challenges in the BCI research is the subject training. Currently, in most online BCI systems, the classifier was trained offline using the data obtained during the experiments without feedback, and used in the next sessions in which the subjects receive feedback. We investigated whether the subject could achieve satisfactory online performance without offline training while the subjects receive feedback from the beginning of the experiments during hand movement imagination. Another important issue in designing an online BCI system is the machine learning to classify the brain signal which is characterized by significant day-to-day and subject-to-subject variations and time-varying probability distributions. Due to these variabilities, we introduce the use of an adaptive probabilistic neural network (APNN) working in a time-varying environment for classification of EEG signals. The experimental evaluation on ten na??ve subjects demonstrated that an average classification accuracy of 75.4\% was obtained during the first experiment session (day) after about 3. min of online training without offline training, and 81.4\% during the second session (day). The average rates during third and eighth sessions are 79.0\% and 84.0\%, respectively, using previously calculated classifier during the first sessions, without online training and without the need to calibrate. The results obtained from more than 5000 trials on ten subjects showed that the method could provide a robust performance over different experiment sessions and different subjects. ?? 2010 IPEM.},

The second purpose was to provide reference charts for grip strength, which could be used in the clinical and research setting. This cross-sectional study was performed at primary and secondary schools and the University of Applied Sciences. Three hundred and eighty-four healthy Dutch children, adolescents, and young adults at the age of 8 to 20 years participated. Isometric muscle strength was measured with a handheld dynamometer of four muscle groups (shoulder abductors, grip strength, hip flexors, and ankle dorsiflexors). Total muscle strength was a summing up of shoulder abductors, hip flexors, and ankle dorsiflexors. All physical therapists participated in a reliability study. The study was started when intratester and intertester reliability was high (Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8). Grip strength was strongly correlated with total muscle strength, with correlation coefficients between 0.736 and 0.890 (p < 0.01). However, the correlation was weaker when controlled for weight (0.485-0.564, p < 0.01). Grip strength is related to total muscle strength. This indicates, in the clinical setting, that grip strength can be used as a tool to have a rapid indication of someone's general muscle strength.

Due to its capital importance in science and in many applications, namely from biomedics to manufacturing, the issue has been matter of deep scientific investigations in both the field of neurophysiology and robotics. While the former is contributing with a profound understanding of the dynamics of real-time control of the slippage and grasp force in the human hand, the latter tries more and more to reproduce, or take inspiration by, the nature's approach, by means of hardware and software technology. On this regard, one of the major constraints robotics has to overcome is the real-time processing of a large amounts of data generated by the tactile sensors while grasping, which poses serious problems to the available computational power. In this paper a bio-inspired approach to tactile data processing has been followed in order to design and test a hardware-software robotic architecture that works on the parallel processing of a large amount of tactile sensing signals. The working principle of the architecture bases on the cellular nonlinear/neural network (CNN) paradigm, while using both hand shape and spatial-temporal features obtained from an array of microfabricated force sensors, in order to control the sensory-motor coordination of the robotic system. Prototypical grasping tasks were selected to measure the system performances applied to a computer-interfaced robotic hand. Successful grasps of several objects, completely unknown to the robot, e.g. soft and deformable objects like plastic bottles, soft balls, and Japanese tofu, have been demonstrated.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to quantify muscle strength and endurance in power grip. METHOD: Workers (74 M and 74 F, 18-72 years) squeezed a dynamometer for a 60 s, 18-cycle test. Initial strength (IS) and final strength (FS) were calculated as the mean peak force for cycles 1-3 and 16-18, respectively. Endurance was defined by the strength decrement index (SDI) where SDI = (IS - FS)/IS x 100. A grip strength-endurance analyzer was constructed from IS and SDI data which were depicted on two parallel, linearly scaled axes. Discrete IS and SDI scores were connected on each axis with a vector. The vector (Vmag) was measured directly from the analyzer and its direction identified from its slope. Integer scales transformed discrete IS and SDI scores into individual strength-endurance performance scores (SEPS). RESULTS: Better than 95\% of the sample (n > or = 141) scored within acceptable test ranges defined as the combined sample mean +/- 2SD, for SDI, Vmag and SEPS. Vmag was the best predictor for SEPS. Linear regression for SEPS was SEPS (combined) = 0.09 (Vmag) - 0.29: (SEE = 0.829). The analyzer revealed individual scores outside acceptable ranges for injured and uninjured efforts. CONCLUSION: The development of a power grip strength-endurance analyzer provided a simple method to graph individual power grip performances. Converting strength and endurance scores to integers and summing them (SEPS) provided a simple means to represent individual estimates of power grip strength-endurance performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: reduced grip strength is associated with adverse health consequences, and there is interest in identifying modifiable influences. Cardiovascular drugs are commonly used by older people, but their effect on muscle strength is unclear. METHODS: we investigated associations between cardiovascular drug use and grip strength among 1,572 men and 1,415 women, aged 59-73, who participated in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of participants were taking a cardiovascular drug. Furosemide was associated with average decreases in grip strength of 3.15 kg (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.90, 5.39, P < 0.01) among men and 2.35 kg (95\% CI 0.93, 3.77, P < 0.01) among women after adjustment for age and height. Corresponding differences for nitrates were 1.84 kg (95\% CI 0.29, 3.39, P = 0.02) among men and 3.66 kg (95\% CI 1.99, 5.33, P < 0.01) among women. Calcium channel blockers and fibrates were associated with reduced grip among women. Statins were not associated with grip. The associations between grip strength and nitrate use in men and nitrate and fibrate use in women were robust to additional adjustment for co-morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: use of some cardiovascular drugs is associated with reduced grip strength in older people. These findings have potential implications for the functional ability of older people treated with these drugs.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the age-related changes in hand grip strength (both right and left hand) among rural and urban Jat females and its correlation with various anthropometric variables. The present cross-sectional study was based on a sample of 600 Jat females (rural=300, urban=300), ranging in age from 40 to 70 years. Findings indicated that rural and urban Jat females exhibit an age-related decline in the mean values of hand grip strength (both right and left hand). The comparison suggested that rural Jat females had significantly higher overall mean value of hand grip strength (kg) (right hand=20.35 vs 18.87, p<0.001 and left hand=17.05 vs 15.68, p<0.001) than their urban counterparts. Mean values for right hand grip strength were found to be higher than left hand grip strength in rural as well as urban Jat females. Significant and positive correlation coefficients exist between hand grip strength (both right and left hand) and various anthropometric variables (height, weight, body mass index, biceps and triceps skinfold thickness) in both rural and urban Jat females. An age-related decline in manual functioning of rural and urban Jat females may be attributed to behavioral factors (reduced physical activity, sedentary lifestyle) and poor nutrition (deteriorating quality and quantity of food intake with increasing age) associated with the normal aging process. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

This study evaluated the effects of an early OT programme in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We conducted a randomised, blind, controlled trial enrolling 60 patients with early RA, divided into 2 groups. At baseline, group 1 received the full information programme and group 2 received no information. In an extension phase, patients in group 2 received the full information programme at 3 months and were assessed at 6 months. The main outcomes were grip strength of hands (as objective assessment) and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score (as subjective assessment). RESULTS: At 3 months, grip strength of the dominant and non-dominant hands increased more in group 1 than in group 2 (p = 0.021 and 0.047 respectively). HAQ score decreased more in group 1 than in group 2 (p<0.001). In the extension phase, changes in grip strength and HAQ score in group 2 were similar to those seen in group 1 between baseline and 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study comparing two schedules of OT programme showed that an early extended information programme improved hand function in patients with early RA.},

abstract = {Indices for lean and fat mass adjusted for height derived from bioelectrical impedance for children aged 7 years have been published previously and their usefulness in the clinical assessment of undernutrition has been demonstrated. However, there is a need for norms that cover a wider age range and to explore their functional significance. The aim of the present study is to derive lean and fat indices for children aged 7-11 years and investigate associations with objective measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and grip strength. Subjects were 9574 children participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data collected longitudinally between ages 7 and 11 were used to derive lean and fat indices using the method of standardised residuals. Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) (9 years) and grip strength (11 years) were also measured. Correlation coefficients and 95 \% CI were calculated to assess the strength of association between lean index, fat index and CRF and grip strength. Equations for calculating lean and fat indices in children aged 7-11 years relative to the ALSPAC population are presented. Lean index was linearly associated with CRF (rboys 0.20 (95 \% CI 0.15, 0.25), rgirls 0.26 (95 \% CI 0.22, 0.30)) and grip strength (rboys 0.29 (95 \% CI 0.26, 0.32), rgirls 0.26 (95 \% CI 0.23, 0.29)). BMI showed slightly weaker associations, while fat index was unrelated to either CRF or grip strength. Lean indices relate to muscle function and fitness while fat index does not.},

abstract = {We inquire whether assessment of an individual's upper limb function may be improved by using specific regional norms rather than consolidated global norms. Grip strengths were measured in a sample of 482 adults across Taiwan, and compared with consolidated norms. To ensure comparable conditions, our procedures were those recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists (ASHT). Overall the mean grip strength of our sample was significantly (male 25\%, female 27\%) lower than consolidated norms derived from largely Caucasian populations. We investigated variables that might relate to this divergence. Results of ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that gender, age and palm length were effective predictors in grip strength. A regression equation was derived. When other variables were matched, palm length appeared an important discriminating factor. Further anthropometric and socio-economic factors also need investigation. Specific regional norms should provide more accuracy for ergonomists and health workers assessing an individual's upper limb function, and may avoid errors in appraisal. This paper suggests grip strength values for Taiwan. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Using a precision grip, 12 participants horizontally oscillated a lightweight object at different movement frequencies (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 Hz) under two types of elastic load. In the first (CENT), the center of oscillation coincided with the neutral position of the object in the elastic force field, leading to two peaks in load force (LF) per cycle of movement (2:1 frequency ratio). In the second (BACK and FRONT), the neutral elastic force position of the object was located outside the range of movement, thus leading to only one LF peak per cycle of movement (1:1 frequency ratio). Results showed that in BACK and FRONT the coupling between grip force (GF) and LF (as reflected by coefficients of correlations) remained strong for all movement frequencies. In contrast, this coupling decreased in CENT as movement frequency increased, with participants switching progressively from two to one GF modulation per cycle of movement. Specific evaluation of performance under conditions giving rise to comparable LF frequencies (CENT at 1.0 Hz vs. BACK/FRONT at 2.0 Hz) confirmed the effect of frequency ratio on GF-LF coupling. We conclude that the control of GF is more efficient when LF varies at the frequency of movement than when it varies at twice this frequency, especially when movement frequency is high. These results are interpreted in the context of coordination dynamics and forward modeling approach.},

abstract = {The interaction between the handle and operator's hand affects the comfort and safety of tool and machine operations. In most of the previous studies, the investigators considered only the normal contact forces. The effect of friction on the joint moments in fingers has not been analyzed. Furthermore, the observed contact forces have not been linked to the internal musculoskeletal loading in the previous experimental studies. In the current study, we proposed a universal model of a hand to evaluate the joint moments in the fingers during grasping tasks. The hand model was developed on the platform of the commercial software package AnyBody. Only four fingers (index, long, ring, and little finger) were included in the model. The anatomical structure of each finger is comprised of four phalanges (distal, middle, proximal, and metacarpal phalange). The simulations were performed using an inverse dynamics technique. The joint angles and the normal contact forces on each finger section reported by previous researchers were used as inputs, while the joint moments of each finger were predicted. The predicted trends of the dependence of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint moments on the cylinder diameter agree with those of the contact forces on the fingers observed in the previous experimental study. Our results show that the DIP and PIP joint moments reach their maximums at a cylinder diameter of about 31 mm, which is consistent with the trend of the finger contact forces measured in the experiments. The proposed approach will be useful for simulating musculoskeletal loading in the hand for occupational activities, thereby optimizing tool-handle design.},

abstract = {Assessment of hand strength is used in a wide range of clinical settings especially during treatment of diseases affecting the function of the hand. This investigation aimed to determine age- and gender-specific reference values for grip and pinch strength in a normal Swiss population with special regard to old and very old subjects as well as to different levels of occupational demand. Hand strength data were collected using a Jamar dynamometer and a pinch gauge with standard testing position, protocol and instructions. Analysis of the data from 1023 tested subjects between 18 and 96 years revealed a curvilinear relationship of grip and pinch strength to age, a correlation to height, weight and significant differences between occupational groups. Hand strength values differed significantly from those of other populations, confirming the thesis that applying normative data internationally is questionable. Age- and gender-specific reference values for grip and pinch strength are presented.},

abstract = {The overall goal of this work is to introduce nerve cuff electrodes into upper extremity hand grasp systems. The first challenge is to develop a nerve cuff electrode that can selectively activate multiple hand functions from common upper extremity peripheral nerves. The Flat Interface Nerve Electrode (FINE) has shown selective stimulation capability in animal trials. The FINE wraps around the nerve and gently reshapes the nerve and aligns the fascicles within the nerve. Our hypothesis is that the FINE can selectively stimulate multi-fascicular nerves in the human upper extremity resulting in selective hand function. To assess the ability of the FINE to produce control of a hand with many degrees of freedom, we have tested the FINE in nonhuman primates. Fascicular organization and fascicle count are important factors to consider when determining electrode placement. The proximal nerve is an attractive electrode location to access both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles in the upper extremity. A challenge with the nonhuman primate model is that the nonhuman primate median and ulnar nerves both have uni-fascicular regions proximally. The human proximal median and ulnar nerves have an encouraging anatomy of multi-fasciculated nerves with redundant fascicles that may result in more selective hand function than is capable in the nonhuman primate.},

abstract = {Reach-to-grasp actions involve several components of forelimb movements needed to direct the hand toward the object to be grasped, and to orient and preshape the hand according to the object axis and shape. Area V6A, which represents a node of the dorsomedial frontoparietal circuits, has so far been implicated only in directing the arm toward different spatial locations. The present results confirm this finding and demonstrate, for the first time, that during reach-to-grasp, V6A neurons are also modulated by the orientation of the hand. In the present work the object to be grasped was a handle that could have different orientations. Reach-to-grasp movements were executed in complete darkness while gazing at a small fixation point. The majority of the tested cells (76/142; 54\%) turned out to be sensitive to the orientation of the handle. Neurons could be modulated during preparation or execution of reach-to-grasp movements. The most represented cells were those modulated by hand orientation both during preparatory and movement periods. These data show that reaching and grasping are processed by the same population of neurons, providing evidence that the coordination of reaching and grasping takes place much earlier than previously thought, i.e., in the parieto-occipital cortex. The data here reported are in agreement with results of lesions to the medial posterior parietal cortex in both monkeys and humans, and with recent imaging data in humans, all of them indicating a functional coupling in the control of reaching and grasping by the medial parietofrontal circuit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine relationships between diet and grip strength in older men and women and to determine whether prenatal growth modifies these relationships. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand nine hundred eighty-three men and women aged 59 to 73 who were born and still living in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. MEASUREMENTS: Weight at birth recorded in Health Visitor ledgers; current food and nutrient intake assessed using an administered food frequency questionnaire; and grip strength measured using a handheld dynamometer. RESULTS: Grip strength was positively associated with height and weight at birth and inversely related to age (all P<.001). Of the dietary factors considered in relation to grip strength, the most important was fatty fish consumption. An increase in grip strength of 0.43 kg (95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.13-0.74) in men (P=.005) and 0.48 kg (95\% CI=0.24-0.72) in women (P<.001) was observed for each additional portion of fatty fish consumed per week. These relationships were independent of adult height, age, and birth weight, each of which had additive effects on grip strength. There was no evidence of interactive effects of weight at birth and adult diet on grip strength. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that fatty fish consumption can have an important influence on muscle function in older men and women. This raises the possibility that the antiinflammatory actions of omega-3 fatty acids may play a role in the prevention of sarcopenia.},

abstract = {When walking with a hand-held object, grip force is coupled in an anticipatory manner to changes in inertial force resulting from the accelerations and decelerations of gait. However, it is not known how grip and inertial forces are organized at the onset of gait, and if the two forces are coupled in the early phases of gait initiation. Moreover, initiating walking with an object involves the coordination of anticipatory postural (e.g., ground reaction force changes) and grasping adjustments. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of ground reaction, grip, and inertial force onsets, and the subsequent development of the coupling of grip and inertial forces during gait initiation with a hand-held object. Ten subjects performed gait initiation with a hand-held object following predictable and unpredictable start signals. We found that ground reaction and grip force onsets were closely linked in time regardless of the predictability of the start signal. In the early period of gait initiation, the grip force started to increase prior to inertial force changes. While the strength of the coupling of grip and inertial forces was moderate in this early phase, it increased to values observed during steady-state gait after the swing foot left the ground. The early grip force increase and the coupling of grip and inertial forces represent an anticipatory control process. This process establishes an appropriate grip-inertial force ratio to ensure object stability during acceleration after foot-off and maintains this increased ratio thereafter. The results suggest that grasping and whole body movements are governed by a common internal representation.},

abstract = {It has been concluded from numerous neurophysiological studies that humans rely on detecting discrete mechanical events that occur when grasping, lifting and replacing an object, i.e., during a prototypical manipulation task. Such events represent transitions between phases of the evolving manipulation task such as object contact, lift-off, etc., and appear to provide critical information required for the sequential control of the task as well as for corrections and parameterization of the task. We have sensorized a biomechatronic anthropomorphic hand with the goal to detect such mechanical transients. The developed sensors were designed to specifically provide the information about task-relevant discrete events rather than to mimic their biological counterparts. To accomplish this we have developed (1) a contact sensor that can be applied to the surface of the robotic fingers and that show a sensitivity to indentation and a spatial resolution comparable to that of the human glabrous skin, and (2) a sensitive low-noise three-axial force sensor that was embedded in the robotic fingertips and showed a frequency response covering the range observed in biological tactile sensors. We describe the design and fabrication of these sensors, their sensory properties and show representative recordings from the sensors during grasp-and-lift tasks. We show how the combined use of the two sensors is able to provide information about crucial mechanical events during such tasks. We discuss the importance of the sensorized hand as a test bed for low-level grasp controllers and for the development of functional sensory feedback from prosthetic devices. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Reproducibility was assessed by standard error of measurement (SEM) and the coefficient of variation (CV). Cutoff values for significant improvement or deterioration were determined and expressed, respectively, as either the smallest detectable difference (SDD) or critical difference (CD). The SDD and CD of grip and pinch strengths were higher in POAH patients than in the healthy group. Among the pinch tests the 2PP findings were least reproducible. The relatively high SDD and CD scores indicate that improvement may be detected only in patients with moderate to severe weakness of grip and pinch. Furthermore, in POAH patients, diagnosing strength changes using the 2PP test is invalid due to low reproducibility.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of grip strength measurements to predict fracture risk in perimenopausal women according to bone mineral density (BMD). A random sample of 971 perimenopausal women from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention study cohort was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the femoral neck and grip strength with a pneumatic squeeze dynamometer in 5-year intervals from baseline (1989-1991). Fractures during the 15-year follow-up were recorded based on self-reports and validated from medical records. In the total sample and in osteopenic or osteoporotic women (T score < -1, n = 284) grip strength was not significantly associated with fracture-free survival rate (P = nonsignificant in Cox regression). In women with normal baseline BMD (N-BMD, T score > -1, n = 687) the lowest grip strength quartile had a significantly lower fracture-free survival rate in the Cox proportional hazard model (P = 0.005, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.0). In the multivariate Cox regression model, T score and grip strength were the only significant predictors of 15-year fracture-free survival in the N-BMD group and a risk index (RI) was formed according to HRs of these two variables. High RI (0-5 points) was associated with significantly lower 15-year fracture-free survival rate (P = 0.001, HR = 0.137) in the N-BMD group. In contrast, 5-year T score was no better a predictor of fractures in the baseline N-BMD group (P = 0.04, HR = 0.36). In conclusion, grip strength predicts 15-year fracture-free survival in perimenopausal women with N-BMD, while 5-year DXA does not seem to be any better a predictor of fracture risk. DXA measurements could be coupled with simple and cost-effective grip strength measurements. Controlling BMD in women with N-BMD could be abandoned.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Jamar dynamometer and the Martin vigorimeter, two instruments often used to assess grip strength, have good validity and reliability when employed to evaluate adults. Grip strength measurements are often performed to assess children with hand disorders. However, the reliability of these measurements when used to assess children under the age of twelve years is unknown. In addition, it is not clear whether reliability differs between younger and older children. The purpose of this study was to establish test-retest reliability for different age groups and to determine which instrument is the most reliable. METHODS: One hundred and four children from a primary school were included. Subjects were divided into three groups: four to six, seven to nine, and ten to twelve years of age. The grip strength of both hands was measured with the Lode dynamometer (equivalent to the Jamar dynamometer) and with the Martin vigorimeter. The mean of three maximum voluntary contractions was recorded for all measurements. A retest was performed after a mean interval of twenty-nine days. RESULTS: In the total group, the intraclass correlation coefficient for the Lode dynamometer was 0.97 (95\% confidence interval, 0.95 to 0.98) for the dominant hand and 0.95 (95\% confidence interval, 0.92 to 0.96) for the nondominant hand and the intraclass correlation coefficient for the Martin vigorimeter was 0.84 (95\% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.89) for the dominant hand and 0.86 (95\% confidence interval, 0.80 to 0.90) for the nondominant hand. The intraclass correlation coefficients in the different age groups were lower than those in the total group because of a lower between-subject variation. The normalized smallest detectable difference between the test and retest values was approximately 25\% for the Lode dynamometer and approximately 31\% for the Martin vigorimeter. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Lode dynamometer and the Martin vigorimeter are reliable instruments with which to measure the grip strength of children under twelve years of age; however, the Lode dynamometer has better test-retest reliability. Furthermore, comparison of the smallest detectable differences showed the Lode dynamometer to be a more accurate instrument.},

The results lead to the conclusion that grip strength is an independent predictor of bone mass in both sexes. The relationship between muscle strength and bone mass is systemic. INTRODUCTION: Previous studies had shown a site-specific relationship between muscle strength and bone in pubertal children. This study evaluated the magnitude of the correlations among grip strength, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at distant bone. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 169 11- to 12-year-old boys and 173 10- to 11-year-old girls came from the baseline result of a cohort study. Grip strength, BMD, BMC, weight, height, pubertal development, weight-bearing activities and calcium intake were measured. Pearson correlations and multiple regressions were used to calculate univariate and adjusted associations among grip strength and bone mass at distant bone. RESULTS: Significant correlations were shown between grip strength and bone mass at hip, spine and whole body (boys: BMC:0.72-0.74, BMD:0.38-0.60; girls: BMC:0.71-0.72, BMD:0.44-0.63; p<0.0001). Multiple regressions with all covariates showed that about 70\% and 50\%, respectively, of the variations in BMC and BMD could be explained but not for whole body BMD. Grip strength was an independent predictor of bone mass, except hip BMD in boys and whole body BMD in girls. Stepwise regression showed that grip strength was a robust predictor in both sexes. Prediction models by grip strength and weight explained about 60\% and 40\% of the variations in BMC of different sites and in BMD of hip and spine, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that grip strength is an independent predictor of bone mass in both sexes. The relationship between muscle strength and bone mass is systemic.},

We compared the reliability of one trial, the best and mean of three trials and the reliability within 6-, 10- and 14-year-old groups. DESIGN: Test-retest study. METHODS: Grip strength with the Grippit instrument was evaluated at two test occasions in 58 children. Intraclass correlation coefficient 2.1 (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM) also expressed as a percentage value (SEM\%), coefficient of repeatability and coefficient of variation were calculated. RESULTS: The test-retest reliability was good for both peak and sustained grip strength. The mean and best of three trials were equally reliable. Peak grip strength best of three trials, for example, was more reliable for the 6-year-olds (ICC 0.96, SEM\% 6.3) and 14-year-olds (ICC 0.96, SEM\% 5.2) compared to the 10-year-olds (ICC 0.78, SEM\% 12.5). For peak grip strength in the whole sample, there was a systematic bias with better performance at the second measurement. CONCLUSION: Grip strength assessment in children with Grippit results in good relative and absolute reliability for peak and sustained grip strength. We recommend that three test trials are used.

These contractions are reminiscent of work tasks associated with the risk of repetitive stress injuries. Based on recommendations from a prior cross-comparison study of these data, the cyclic grip-force contractions were temporally aligned cycle-by-cycle to the achieved grip force profile, then EMG amplitude was computed using signal whitening (500 ms window) and MNF was computed using the short-time Fourier transform (500 ms window). In addition, brief (8 s) constant-force (static) contractions were interspersed within the cyclic contractions every 5 min. MNF was tracked during these periods. All subjects reported a marked increase in pain/discomfort/fatigue during the contraction trials, until self-selecting to discontinue contractions after 30-90 min. Discomfort returned to near-baseline levels during the ensuing 45 min recovery (rest) period. No statistical trend was found in either EMG amplitude or MNF during the cyclic contractions or the recovery period. Initial MNF and MNF slope were monitored during the 8 s interspersed static contractions. These parameters also did not follow any consistent trend. These results indicate limitations in the use of these EMG descriptors for assessment of fatigue during long-duration, force-varying contractions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Methods: Intraindividual and interindividual variations of grip strength and their relation to several anthropometric factors were analyzed in a standardized manner for 769 healthy adults (women, n = 403; men, n = 366) aged between 20 years and 95 years. Measurements were done in neutral position of arm, forearm, and wrist on setting II of a Baseline digital hydraulic dynamometer (NexGen Ergonomics Inc. Quebec, Canada). Results: Mean strength was about 41\% less in women (right 29 kg; left 27 kg) than in men (right 49 kg; left 47 kg) resulting in a ratio of left to right hand slightly above .95 in both genders. During the course of life, hand strength develops comparably in both genders peaking at 35 years of age and decreasing continuously further on. Anthropometric variables such as forearm circumference and length, hand size, or body mass showed a positive correlation with grip strength. Body mass index, type of work, and hand dominance showed only a partial positive correlation or no correlation with grip strength. Gender and age, followed by parameters representing body length and obesity, were observed to have the highest predictive value for handgrip strength and were therefore entered into the generation of prediction equations. Conclusions: We recommend side adjustment of measured values for intraindividual comparison and inclusion of information regarding anthropometric characteristics, as well as using gender- and age-adjusted reference values, whereas hand dominance can be neglected. The regression equations we generated might prove to be useful for clinicians or for those who use normative values within software to provide more accurate predictions of strength scores for specific applications. © 2008 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

abstract = {The amplitude and mean power spectral frequency (MNF) of the electromyogram (EMG) of flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor carpi radialis muscles were monitored during cyclic, force-varying, constant-posture, submaximal, grip-force contractions until endurance. These contractions are reminiscent of work tasks associated with the risk of repetitive stress injuries. Based on recommendations from a prior cross-comparison study of these data, the cyclic grip-force contractions were temporally aligned cycle-by-cycle to the achieved grip force profile, then EMG amplitude was computed using signal whitening (500 ms window) and MNF was computed using the short-time Fourier transform (500 ms window). In addition, brief (8 s) constant-force (static) contractions were interspersed within the cyclic contractions every 5 min. MNF was tracked during these periods. All subjects reported a marked increase in pain/discomfort/fatigue during the contraction trials, until self-selecting to discontinue contractions after 30-90 min. Discomfort returned to near-baseline levels during the ensuing 45 min recovery (rest) period. No statistical trend was found in either EMG amplitude or MNF during the cyclic contractions or the recovery period. Initial MNF and MNF slope were monitored during the 8 s interspersed static contractions. These parameters also did not follow any consistent trend. These results indicate limitations in the use of these EMG descriptors for assessment of fatigue during long-duration, force-varying contractions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We developed electrophysiologic methods for testing the three major forelimb nerves as a tool to evaluate motor and sensory recovery in rats. Median, ulnar, or radial nerves were transected and repaired in Sprague-Dawley rats. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were recorded preoperatively and at various postoperative intervals. Correlation between grip strength and CMAPs was investigated. Reliable CMAPs were recorded for all three nerves. Median- or ulnar-nerve-derived SSEPs were reliably recorded; radial SSEPs could not be recorded. CMAPs followed typical regeneration patterns after nerve repair. SSEPs showed a consistent peak latency but fluctuating amplitude. Grip strength and median CMAP amplitude correlated positively. We conclude that it is possible to conduct minimally invasive electrophysiologic testing in rat forelimbs. The CMAP is a valid parameter that shows the typical time course of nerve regeneration and reinnervation.},

The subjects were 15 healthy young males (mean age 22.1+/-0.7 yr, mean height 171.3+/-3.4 cm, mean mass 64.5+/-4.1 kg). All subjects were right-handed. Peak power was measured by both hands with 6 different loads of 20\%-70\% of maximum voluntary contraction. The maximum voluntary contraction of hand grip movement and elbow flexion movement was significantly larger in the dominant hand. Peak power of the dominant hand was larger in all loads in hand grip movement and in loads of 20\% and 30\% of maximum voluntary contraction in elbow flexion movement. In short, lateral dominance was confirmed. Peak power was significantly larger in hand grip movement than in elbow flexion movement in both hands. Peak velocity decreased with increasing loads in both movements, but peak power increased until about 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction and then decreased. The peak power ratio of the dominant hand to the nondominant hand was significantly larger in hand grip movement than in elbow flexion movement in all loads and the peak power ratio in elbow flexion movement was more marked in light loads. In conclusion, both powers showed lateral dominance. Lateral dominance is more marked in hand grip power.},

abstract = {Object manipulation requires rapid increase in grip force to prevent slippage when the load force of the object suddenly increases. Previous experiments have shown that grip force reactions interact between the hands when holding a single object. Here we test whether this interaction is modulated by the object dynamics experienced before the perturbation of the load force. We hypothesized that coupling of grip forces should be stronger when holding a single object than when holding separate objects. We measured the grip force reactions elicited by unpredictable load perturbations when participants were instructed to hold one single or two separate objects. We simulated these objects both visually and dynamically using a virtual environment consisting of two robotic devices and a calibrated stereo display. In contrast to previous studies, the load forces arising from a single object could be uncoupled at the moment of perturbation, allowing for a pure measurement of grip force coupling. Participants increased grip forces rapidly (onset approximately 70 ms) in response to perturbations. Grip force increases were stronger when the load force on the other hand also increased. No such coupling was present in the reaction of the arms to the load force increase. Surprisingly, however, the grip force interaction did not depend on the nature of the manipulated object. These results show fast obligatory coupling of bimanual grip force responses. Although this coupling may play a functional role for providing stability in bimanual object manipulation, it seems to constitute a relatively hard-wired modulation of a reflex.},

abstract = {Topographically, the hand is described by its anterior (palmar) and posterior (dorsal) surfaces that encompass a hollow cavity that changes its shape during hand preshaping and grasping according to the object to be grasped. The hollow cavity has been described as consisting of three arches that run in different directions: transverse, longitudinal and oblique, spanning the anterior surface of the hand. Although described anatomically, the modulation in the palmar arches has not been investigated kinematically during actual grasping. In this study, we describe and compare biomechanical formulations of the palmar arch, specifically, the distal transverse and the oblique arches. In addition, we introduce another biomechanical formulation of the palmar arch, called the kinematic transverse arch that takes account of the thenar and hypothenar involvement in arch formation. Hand shape modulation during two natural power-grasping tasks was studied in eight healthy adults. Results showed a significant influence of the overall contribution of thenar and hypothenar movement during hand shape modulation. While there was relatively more thenar contribution during transport shaping, more hypothenar contribution was evident during preshaping and contact shaping-the two phases of grasping during which the hand establishes contact with the object. The advantage of the new formulation is that it better described the contributions from thenar and hypothenar movement to palmar arch formation which may be a more accurate depiction of hand preshaping during grasping. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite the wide use of surface electromyography (EMG) to study pedalling movement, there is a paucity of data concerning the muscular activity during uphill cycling, notably in standing posture. The aim of this study was to investigate the muscular activity of eight lower limb muscles and four upper limb muscles across various laboratory pedalling exercises which simulated uphill cycling conditions. Ten trained cyclists rode at 80\% of their maximal aerobic power on an inclined motorised treadmill (4\%, 7\% and 10\%) with using two pedalling postures (seated and standing). Two additional rides were made in standing at 4\% slope to test the effect of the change of the hand grip position (from brake levers to the drops of the handlebar), and the influence of the lateral sways of the bicycle. For this last goal, the bicycle was fixed on a stationary ergometer to prevent the lean of the bicycle side-to-side. EMG was recorded from M. gluteus maximus (GM), M. vastus medialis (VM), M. rectus femoris (RF), M. biceps femoris (BF), M. semimembranosus (SM), M. gastrocnemius medialis (GAS), M. soleus (SOL), M. tibialis anterior (TA), M. biceps brachii (BB), M. triceps brachii (TB), M. rectus abdominis (RA) and M. erector spinae (ES). Unlike the slope, the change of pedalling posture in uphill cycling had a significant effect on the EMG activity, except for the three muscles crossing the ankle's joint (GAS, SOL and TA). Intensity and duration of GM, VM, RF, BF, BB, TA, RA and ES activity were greater in standing while SM activity showed a slight decrease. In standing, global activity of upper limb was higher when the hand grip position was changed from brake level to the drops, but lower when the lateral sways of the bicycle were constrained. These results seem to be related to (1) the increase of the peak pedal force, (2) the change of the hip and knee joint moments, (3) the need to stabilize pelvic in reference with removing the saddle support, and (4) the shift of the mass centre forward. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In non-human primates grasp-related sensorimotor transformations are accomplished in a circuit involving the anterior intraparietal sulcus (area AIP) and both the ventral and the dorsal sectors of the premotor cortex (vPMC and dPMC, respectively). Although a human homologue of such a circuit has been identified whether activity within this circuit varies depending on handedness has yet to be investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explicitly test how handedness modulates activity within human grasping-related brain areas. Right- and left-handers subjects were requested to reach towards and grasp an object with either the right or the left hand using a precision grip while scanned. A kinematic study was conducted with similar procedures as a behavioral counterpart for the fMRI experiment. Results from a factorial design revealed significant activity within the right dPMC, the right cerebellum and AIP bilaterally. The pattern of activity within these areas mirrored the results found for the behavioral study. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Data are discussed in terms of an handedness-independent role for the right dPMC in monitoring hand shaping, the need for bilateral AIP activity for the performance of precision grip movements which varies depending on handedness and the involvement of the cerebellum in terms of its connections with AIP. These results provide the first compelling evidence of specific grasping related neural activity depending on handedness.},

The results lead to the conclusion that grip strength is an independent predictor of bone mass in both sexes. The relationship between muscle strength and bone mass is systemic. INTRODUCTION: Previous studies had shown a site-specific relationship between muscle strength and bone in pubertal children. This study evaluated the magnitude of the correlations among grip strength, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at distant bone. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 169 11- to 12-year-old boys and 173 10- to 11-year-old girls came from the baseline result of a cohort study. Grip strength, BMD, BMC, weight, height, pubertal development, weight-bearing activities and calcium intake were measured. Pearson correlations and multiple regressions were used to calculate univariate and adjusted associations among grip strength and bone mass at distant bone. RESULTS: Significant correlations were shown between grip strength and bone mass at hip, spine and whole body (boys: BMC:0.72-0.74, BMD:0.38-0.60; girls: BMC:0.71-0.72, BMD:0.44-0.63; p<0.0001). Multiple regressions with all covariates showed that about 70\% and 50\%, respectively, of the variations in BMC and BMD could be explained but not for whole body BMD. Grip strength was an independent predictor of bone mass, except hip BMD in boys and whole body BMD in girls. Stepwise regression showed that grip strength was a robust predictor in both sexes. Prediction models by grip strength and weight explained about 60\% and 40\% of the variations in BMC of different sites and in BMD of hip and spine, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that grip strength is an independent predictor of bone mass in both sexes. The relationship between muscle strength and bone mass is systemic.},

The goal of this research is to develop an interaction technique that will allow the BCI to be effective in real-world scenarios for hand grasp control. Moreover, for consistency of man-machine interface, it is desirable the intended movement to be what the subject imagines. For this purpose, we developed an on-line BCI which was based on the classification of EEG associated with imagination of the movement of hand grasping and resting state. A classifier based on probabilistic neural network (PNN) was introduced for classifying the EEG. The PNN is a feedforward neural network that realizes the Bayes decision discriminant function by estimating probability density function using mixtures of Gaussian kernels. Two types of classification schemes were considered here for on-line hand control: adaptive and static. In contrast to static classification, the adaptive classifier was continuously updated on-line during recording. The experimental evaluation on six subjects on different days demonstrated that by using the static scheme, a classification accuracy as high as the rate obtained by the adaptive scheme can be achieved. At the best case, an average classification accuracy of 93.0\% and 85.8\% was obtained using adaptive and static scheme, respectively. The results obtained from more than 1500 trials on six subjects showed that interactive virtual reality environment can be used as an effective tool for subject training in BCI.},

abstract = {Purpose: The first aim was to determine whether there is an optimal grip span for determining the maximum hand grip strength in boys and girls aged 6 to 12 years and whether the optimal grip span was related to hand span. If so, the second aim was to derive a mathematical equation relating hand span and optimal grip span. Methods: A total of 123 boys (9 y ± 2) and 70 girls (8 y ± 2) were evaluated. Each hand was randomly tested on 10 occasions using 5 different grip spans, allowing a 1-minute rest between attempts. The hand span was measured from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger with the hand opened widely. Results: An optimal grip span to determine maximum hand grip strength was identified for both genders. Hand span and optimal grip span showed a significant linear association in the studied children. The equation relating grip span as a function of hand span in boys is formulated as y = x/4 + 0.44 and in girls as y = 0.3x - 0.52, where x is the hand span (maximal width between first and fifth fingers) and y is the optimal grip span. Conclusions: The results suggest that there is an optimal grip span to which the dynamometer should be adjusted when measuring hand grip strength in children. The optimal grip span was influenced by hand span in both genders. © 2008 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

RESULTS: Based on the analysis, average values for the left and right hands of men and women in each age stratum were derived. CONCLUSIONS: The derived values can serve as a standard of comparison for individual patients. An individual whose grip strength is below the lower limit of the confidence intervals of each stratum can be confidently considered to have less than average grip strength.},

Index finger strength was largely unaffected by simulated stiffness of the other fingers. The degree of simulated stiffness influenced the strength of the other fingers, but there was considerable intersubject variability, suggesting that the significance of the quadriga effect varies between individuals. An anatomical basis for our findings is suggested. ?? 2006 The British Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

abstract = {This study examined patterns of grip strength when maximal and submaximal effort are applied. Using a sensor glove, 50 healthy subjects performed two different power grips. Both maximal and submaximal gripping showed characteristic patterns of strength distribution that were independent of the degree of power applied. Significant differences were also noted in the strength distribution patterns, depending on whether the grip was performed at maximal, or submaximal, strength. The small finger plays a decisive role in this. In maximal strength gripping, the total measured strength is distributed relatively evenly over all four fingers, with each finger contributing between 23\% and 27\% of the total strength. In submaximal strength gripping, the little finger is involved very little and only contributes between 14\% and 15\% of the total strength, with the remainder of the gripping distributed relatively evenly between the index, middle and ring fingers, each of which contributes between 26\% and 32\% of the total. © 2007 The British Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

abstract = {Two hundred and fifty subjects were recruited. Age, sex, hand preference and anthropometric measurements were recorded for each subject. Grip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic dynamometer. Multiple regression analyses were performed. One hundred and seventy two subjects were men and 78 were women. Twenty-six subjects were left hand dominant. Hand grip strength was greatest for the 35 to 44 year old group for both sexes. Grip strength was consistently greater for men than women. Contralateral grip strength predicted maximum grip strength for both sexes. Forearm circumference predicted maximum hand grip strength for men. Although there was a large range of forearm circumferences in the population, there was little difference between sides for each subject (100\% less than 2 cm). The demonstrated relationships between: (i) contralateral grip strengths and (ii) grip strength and forearm circumference lead us to suggest that for certain pathologies, a difference in forearm circumference greater than 2 cm may lend credence to a measurement of diminished grip strength. ?? 2006.},

The factors that contribute to loss of muscle strength with aging have not been well characterized. Selenium is important in normal muscle function because of its role in selenoenzymes that protect muscle against oxidative damage. We hypothesized that low serum selenium concentrations were associated with poor grip strength.

We studied the association of level of and rate of change in strength in 877 older persons without dementia at baseline and risk of AD.

These results persisted even after excluding persons who developed AD in the first 5 years of follow-up. In a subsequent model examining the association of the annual rate of change in grip strength with incident AD, each 1-lb annual decline in grip strength was associated with about a 9\% increase in the risk of AD (HR, 0.915; 95\% CI, 0.884-0.948). Results were similar after controlling for level and rate of change in body mass index, parkinsonian signs, physical and cognitive activity, depressive symptoms, vascular diseases and risk factors, social networks and early-life socioeconomic status.

Method: Respondents were 272 members of the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists who indicated that pediatrics was their primary area of clinical practice. A purpose-designed survey was mailed to participants. Results: The response rate was adequate at 27.2\% (n = 272/1,000). The primary client groups seen by pediatric therapists were developmental delay, learning disability, neurology, and those requiring rehabilitation. Sensory Integration and Client-Centred Practice were the most frequently utilized theories/practice models. The most commonly used assessments were the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration, Peabody DevelopmentalMotor Scales, Bruininks-Oseretsky Test ofMotor Proficiency, and the Sensory Profile. The most frequently used intervention techniques with pediatric clients were the instruction of parents/caregivers and children; assistive devices, adaptive equipment, and technology; activities of daily living/self-care skills; and environmental modification/ access/structuring/ adaptation. Conclusions: Pediatric occupational therapists mainly used theories/ practice models that focused on three areas: Client-Centred practice, practice-oriented theories, and several theories/practice models based on occupation. Interventions focused on teaching, activities unique to occupational therapy, and on the functional needs of the client. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hand-grip strength has been identified as one limiting factor for manual lifting and carrying loads. To obtain epidemiologically relevant hand-grip strength data for pre-employment screening, we determined maximal isometric hand-grip strength in 1,654 healthy men and 533 healthy women aged 20-25 years. Moreover, to assess the potential margins for improvement in hand-grip strength of women by training, we studied 60 highly trained elite female athletes from sports known to require high hand-grip forces (judo, handball). Maximal isometric hand-grip force was recorded over 15 s using a handheld hand-grip ergometer. Biometric parameters included lean body mass (LBM) and hand dimensions. Mean maximal hand-grip strength showed the expected clear difference between men (541 N) and women (329 N). Less expected was the gender related distribution of hand-grip strength: 90\% of females produced less force than 95\% of males. Though female athletes were significantly stronger (444 N) than their untrained female counterparts, this value corresponded to only the 25th percentile of the male subjects. Hand-grip strength was linearly correlated with LBM. Furthermore, both relative hand-grip strength parameters (F (max)/body weight and F (max)/LBM) did not show any correlation to hand dimensions. The present findings show that the differences in hand-grip strength of men and women are larger than previously reported. An appreciable difference still remains when using lean body mass as reference. The results of female national elite athletes even indicate that the strength level attainable by extremely high training will rarely surpass the 50th percentile of untrained or not specifically trained men.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies in older people have shown that grip strength predicts all-cause mortality. The mechanisms are unclear. Muscle strength declines with age, accompanied by a loss of muscle mass and an increase in fat, but the role that body composition plays in the association between grip strength and mortality has been little explored. We investigated the relation between grip strength, body composition, and cause-specific and total mortality in 800 men and women aged 65 and over. METHODS: During 197374 the UK Department of Health and Social Security surveyed random samples of men and women aged 65 and over living in eight areas of Britain to assess the nutritional state of the elderly population. The survey included a clinical examination by a geriatrician who assessed grip strength and anthropometry. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine mortality over 24 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Poorer grip strength was associated with increased mortality from all-causes, from cardiovascular disease, and from cancer in men, though not in women. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, including arm muscle area and BMI, the relative risk of death in men was 0.81 (95\% CI 0.700.95) from all-causes, 0.73 (95\% CI 0.600.89) from cardiovascular disease, and 0.81 (95\% CI 0.660.98) from cancer per SD increase in grip strength. These associations remained statistically significant after further adjustment for fat-free mass or \% body fat. CONCLUSION: Grip strength is a long-term predictor of mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in men. Muscle size and other indicators of body composition did not explain these associations.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength with age, is significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in older people. AIM: To determine whether there is a relationship between grip strength and features of the metabolic syndrome. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data were collected on grip strength, fasting glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, waist circumference and 2 h glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test, in a population-based sample of 2677 men and women aged 59-73 years. RESULTS: In men and women combined, a standard deviation (SD) decrease in grip strength was significantly associated with higher: fasting triglycerides (0.05 SD unit increase, 95\%CI 0.02-0.09, p = 0.006); blood pressure (OR 1.13, 95\%CI 1.04-1.24, p = 0.004); waist circumference (0.08 SD unit increase, 95\%CI 0.06-0.10, p < 0.001); 2 h glucose (0.07 SD unit increase, 95\%CI 0.03-0.11, p = 0.001) and HOMA resistance (0.05 SD unit increase, 95\%CI 0.01-0.09, p = 0.008), after adjustment for gender, weight, age, walking speed, social class, smoking habit and alcohol intake. Lower grip strength was also significantly associated with increased odds of having the metabolic syndrome according to both the ATPIII (OR 1.18, 95\%CI 1.07-1.30, p < 0.001) and IDF definitions (OR 1.11, 95\%CI 1.01-1.22, p = 0.03). DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that impaired grip strength is associated with the individual features, as well as with the overall summary definitions, of the metabolic syndrome. The potential for grip strength to be used in the clinical setting needs to be explored.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a reliable, sensitive, quantitative measure of grip myotonia and strength and to determine whether CTG repeat length is correlated with grip myotonia and with muscle strength in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Three maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the finger flexors (i.e., handgrip) were recorded on 2 successive days using a computerized handgrip myometer in 29 genetically confirmed DM1 patients and 17 normals. An automated computer program calculated MVIC peak force (PF) and relaxation times (RTs) along the declining (relaxation) phase of the force recordings at 90\%, 75\%, 50\%, 10\%, and 5\% of PF. Patients also underwent quantitative strength testing (QST) manual muscle testing (MMT). The patients had longer grip RTs and lower PFs than normals. RT (90\% to 5\%) was above the normal mean +2.5 SD in 25 (86\%) patients. In DM1, prolongation of RT was mainly in the terminal (50\% to 5\%), rather than the initial (90\% to 50\%) phase of relaxation. PFs and RTs for each patient were reproducible on consecutive days. RTs were positively correlated with leukocyte CTG repeat length, whereas measures of muscle strength, such as PF, QST, and MMT, were negatively correlated with repeat length. We conclude that computerized handgrip myometry provides a sensitive, reliable measure of myotonia and strength in DM1 and offers a method to assess natural history and response to treatment.},

abstract = {Grip strength, an indicator of muscle strength, has been shown to be a predictor of poor outcomes among older adults. Protein carbonylation, an indicator of oxidative damage to proteins, leads to cellular dysfunction and a decline in tissue function. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. The objective was to determine whether serum protein carbonyl concentrations are associated with grip strength in older women living in the community. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 672 women, aged 65 and older, from the Women's Health and Aging Study (WHAS) I, the one-third most disabled women residing in the community in Baltimore, MD. Protein carbonyl and grip strength were measured in each patient. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, body mass index, and Mini-Mental Status Examination score, protein carbonyls (nmol/mg) were associated with grip strength (beta = -6.77, P < 0.01). The statistical association was unchanged after the analysis adjusted for hypertension, congestive heart failure, and depression. Ordered logistic regression models adjusted for the above factors showed that protein carbonyls are associated with increased odds of being in the lower quartiles of grip strength (odds ratio 8.74, 95\% confidence interval 1.06-71.89, P = 0.043). These results suggest oxidative protein damage is independently associated with low grip strength among older women living in the community. Increased oxidative stress may be contributing to loss of muscle strength in older adults.},

To compare these parameters in young adults with unilateral cerebral palsy and healthy subjects. To evaluate the correlation of these variables with functional activities. SUBJECTS: Twenty-six healthy subjects and 26 young adults with unilateral cerebral palsy recruited from a cohort study in young adults with cerebral palsy. METHODS: Maximal grip strength, muscle coordination and muscle endurance were measured in both hands of all subjects. In the healthy subjects test-retest reliability was established. In the young adults with cerebral palsy, the Melbourne assessment and Abilhand Questionnaire were used to determine functional activities. RESULTS: For the dominant and non-dominant hand the intraclass correlation coefficients for the maximal grip strength were 0.93 and 0.91, for the muscle coordination 0.81 and 0.86, and for the muscle endurance 0.59 for both sides. Maximal grip strength of the involved hand of patients was reduced compared with the uninvolved hand and compared with healthy subjects. There was no difference in muscle coordination and muscle endurance between the involved and uninvolved hands. These parameters, however, were significantly reduced in both hands compared with healthy subjects. Correlations between grip strength parameters and activity limitations were relatively weak and non-linear. CONCLUSION: Performance of activity is not directly related to grip strength parameters. The uninvolved hand of young adults with unilateral cerebral palsy also has impaired function.},

abstract = {In humans, both clinical and functional imaging studies have evidenced the critical role played by the posterior parietal cortex, and particularly by the anterior intraparietal area (AIP), in skilled hand movements. However, the exact contribution of AIP to precision grasping remains debated. Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce virtual lesions of the left and/or right AIP in subjects performing a grip-lift task with either hand. We found that, during movement preparation, a virtual lesion of AIP had distinct consequences on precision grasping of either hand depending on its time of occurrence: TMS applied 270-220 ms before the fingers contacted the manipulandum altered specifically the hand shaping, whereas lesions induced 170-120 ms before contact time only affected the grip force scaling. The lateralization of these two processes in AIP is also strikingly different: whereas a bilateral lesion of AIP was necessary to impair hand shaping, only a unilateral lesion of the left AIP altered the grip force scaling in either hand. The present study shows that, during movement preparation, AIP is responsible for processing two distinct, temporally dissociated, precision grasping parameters, regardless of the hand in use. This indicates that the contribution of AIP to hand movements is "effector-independent," a finding that may explain the invariance of grasping movements performed with either hand.},

RESULTS: Aerobic capacity correlated positively with HbA1c and lean body mass and negatively with body mass index and fat mass. Handgrip strength correlated positively with aerobic capacity and negatively with HbA1c and fat mass. In addition, there was a positive correlation between HbA1c and total cholesterol. CONCLUSION: Patients with Type 1 diabetes who have good aerobic capacity have poorer glycaemic control. However, this was an observational study and the results must be interpreted with caution. Further investigation into how these patients manage blood glucose during exercise is required.},

abstract = {Present evidence suggests that modern humans were the first hominid species to successfully colonize high-latitude environments (> or =55 degrees N). Given evidence for a recent (<200,000 years) lower latitude naissance of modern humans, the global dispersal and successful settlement of arctic and subarctic regions represent an unprecedented adaptive shift. This adaptive shift, which included cultural, behavioral, and biological dimensions, allowed human populations to cope with the myriad environmental stressors encountered in circumpolar regions. Although unique morphological and physiological adaptations among contemporary northern residents have been recognized for decades, human biologists are only now beginning to consider whether biological adaptations to regional environmental conditions influence health changes associated with economic modernization and lifestyle change. Recent studies have documented basal metabolic rates (BMRs) among indigenous Siberian populations that are systematically elevated compared to lower latitude groups; this metabolic elevation apparently is a physiological adaptation to cold stress experienced in the circumpolar environment. Important health implications of metabolic adaptation are suggested by research with the Yakut (Sakha), Evenki, and Buriat of Siberia. BMR is significantly positively correlated with blood pressure, independently of body size, body composition, and various potentially confounding variables (e.g., age and smoking). Further, this research has documented a significant negative association between BMR and LDL cholesterol, which remains after controlling for potential confounders; this suggests that high metabolic turnover among indigenous Siberians has a protective effect with regard to plasma lipid levels. These results underscore the importance of incorporating an evolutionary approach into health research among northern populations.},

abstract = {Several human imaging studies have described the neural network involved in power grip under visual control and the subset of cortical areas within this network that are sensitive to force modulation. As there is behavioral evidence for late maturation in even simple hand motor tasks involving visual feedback, we aimed at identifying the neural correlates of these developmental changes. Subjects from three developmental age groups (9-11, 15-17, and adults) performed the same power grip task in both a functional magnetic resonance imaging and an event-related potential (ERP) session. Trials started with a visual target indicating whether to squeeze at 20\%, 40\%, or 75\% of their maximum and online visual feedback on the actual amount of force was provided. Longer reaction times and more shallow slopes of the force curve characterized the behavior of the younger age groups, especially the children. Both neurophysiological methods detected both general as well as force modulation-specific maturational changes. General development was characterized by decreasing ERP amplitudes and increasing deactivation of an extended network, closely resembling the so-called "default" network. The most pronounced developmental changes specific for force control were observed in an ERP component and brain regions involved in feedback processing. In contrast to adult subjects, we found evidence for a stronger dependency on visual feedback information in the younger age groups. Our results also suggest that the ability to deactivate task-irrelevant networks might be a late developmental achievement.},

The current study is to examine grip-load force coupling when motion of the hand with an object was either self-generated (voluntary) or externally generated. Subjects performed similar cyclic movements of different loads at various frequencies with three types of manipulations: 1) voluntary oscillation, 2) oscillating the right arm via the pulley system by the left leg (self-driven oscillation), and 3) oscillating the arm via the pulley system by another person (other-driven oscillation). During the self-generated movements: 1) the grip forces were larger and 2) grip-load force modulation was more pronounced than in the externally generated movements. The G-L adjustments are not completely determined by the mechanics of object motion; nonmechanical factors related to movement performance, for instance perceptual factors, may affect the G-L coupling. ?? 2007 Hanley \& Belfus.},

Among them, 24\% correlated only with target orientations which determined hand orientation, 18\% correlated only with target location (movement direction), 24\% correlated with both target orientations and locations. Thus, hand orientation is an important control parameter during reach-to-grasp task. The data showed that in the motor cortex a portion of neurons could code hand orientation independent of movement direction. At the same time, cells encoding hand orientations and cells encoding movement directions coexist in the same region of the motor cortex, which indicates there probably exists a common pathway in M1 that controls both parameters.},

This relationship was investigated in 30 healthy heterosexual males, who viewed both erotic and nonerotic videos. A questionnaire was used to assess the extent of sexual arousal. The grip strengths of both hands were measured with a five-position (P1-P5) dynamometer, before and after watching the videos. After watching the erotic video, there was a statistically significant reduction in grip strength for the P2 position, with nonsignificant overall reductions in grip strength for all other positions tested. No such effect was observed in control tests. The results indicate that during sexual arousal, the neural system is likely to reduce the output to muscles not directly related to sexual function, presumably to enhance the physiological responses of sexual arousal.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To measure the hand grip strength of Malaysians aged 18 to 65 years. METHODS. Between January and April 2003, 412 subjects (200 women and 212 men) were recruited from staff, students, and visitors of the University of Malaya Medical Centre. Socioeconomic, general health, and lifestyle data were collected from each subject using a standard questionnaire. Weight and height were measured prior to testing. Standardised positioning and instructions based on several hand grip protocols were used. Data were collected using the LIDO kinetic work set. RESULTS. 93\% of the subjects were right-hand dominant and 7\% were left-hand dominant. Hand grip strength was significantly correlated with hand dominance, gender, occupation, height, and weight, but not body mass index. No significant differences in grip strength were noted with regard to race or level of income. Men were stronger than women in all age-groups, with a ratio of 1.75:1. In both right- and left-hand dominant groups, the dominant hand was consistently stronger than the non-dominant side, with a ratio of 1.12:1 in the right-hand dominant group and 1.05:1 in the left-hand dominant group. The strongest hand grip strength in the right-hand dominant group occurred in the age-group of 25 to 34 years; in the left-hand dominant group it was in the age-group of 18 to 24 years. In western populations, the mean grip strength can be as much as 1.5 times greater than in the Malaysian population. CONCLUSION. Data derived from western populations cannot be applied to a comparable Malaysian population. Gender, hand dominance, age, occupation, weight, and height must be considered when establishing normal values for grip strength. },

abstract = {We studied the coordination of arm and wrist motion in a task requiring fine control of hand orientation. Subjects were instructed to reach and grasp one of two targets positioned in the frontal plane at various orientations. The task was performed under three target conditions: fixed orientation, predictably perturbed orientation, and randomly perturbed orientation. For fixed target orientations, the hand began to rotate to the required orientation from the beginning of the reach. Hand peak supination angles scaled linearly with target orientations. The trajectories of hand/arm joint angles also had a one-to-one relationship with different target orientations. These demonstrate that target orientation is a constraint on the hand/arm final orientation, a control variable to be specified in advance by the central nervous system (CNS). Under perturbation conditions, subjects were still able to complete the task smoothly. In the early trials of the predictable perturbation, the hand rotated first to the original target orientation and then corrected for the final target orientation. Initial corrections occurred about 200 ms after the onset of perturbation. This latency decreased as the subjects adapted to the perturbation, and the hand orientation trajectory shifted to match the unperturbed trajectory for the final orientation. By contrast, we observed no clear changes in orientation trajectory under the randomly perturbed conditions. These suggest that feedback control is important to the execution of the movement, but that the CNS tends to optimize feedforward planning rather than feedback correction when the disturbance information is predictable.},

BMD of lumbar spine, femoral neck, proximal radius-ulna (PRU) and distal radius-ulna (DRU) sites were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and grip strength by using a hand dynamometer. Grip strength and BMD values of PRU and DRU at forearms were significantly higher on the dominant sides (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that only the grip strength of the same side was the best predictor of the BMD of the dominant and non-dominant PRU with a ratio of 8.5 and 10.2\%, respectively, whereas grip strength of the same side, age and weight were the best predictors of the BMD of the dominant and non-dominant DRU with a ratio of 25 and 24.6\%, respectively. There was no predictive value of grip strength for BMD of lumbar spine and femoral neck. In conclusion, grip strength appears to be predictive of site specific rather than systemic BMD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to investigate the relationship between grip strength and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). DESIGN: cross-sectional survey within a cohort study design. SETTING: the county of Hertfordshire in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: a total of 2,987 community-dwelling men and women aged 59-73 years of age. MEASUREMENTS: grip strength was used as a marker of sarcopaenia and measured using a Jamar dynamometer. HRQoL was assessed using the eight domain scores of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, and subjects in the lowest sex-specific fifth of the distribution were classified as having 'poor' status for each domain. RESULTS: men and women with lower grip strength were significantly more likely to report a poor as opposed to excellent to fair overall opinion of their general health (GH) [odds ratio (OR) per kilogram decrease in grip strength = 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.06-1.19, P < 0.001 in men, 1.13, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.20, P < 0.001 in women]. Among men, after adjustment for age, size, physical activity and known co-morbidity, decreased grip strength was associated with increased prevalence of poor SF-36 scores for the physical functioning (PF) (OR per kilogram decrease in grip strength = 1.03, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.06, P = 0.007) and GH domains (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.05, P = 0.01). Similar associations were seen in women. CONCLUSIONS: our findings suggest that lower grip strength is associated with reduced HRQoL in older men and women. This does not appear to be explained by age, size, physical activity or co-morbidity and may reflect the link between sarcopaenia and generalised frailty. Individuals with sarcopaenia may benefit from interventions to improve muscle mass and strength before the onset of chronic disorders usually associated with impaired HRQoL.},

abstract = {The cerebellar cortex and nuclei play important roles in the learning, planning, and execution of reach-to-grasp and prehensile movements. However, few studies have investigated the signals carried by cerebellar neurons during reach-to-grasp, particularly signals relating to target object properties, hand shape, and grasp force. In this study, the simple spike discharge of 77 Purkinje cells was recorded as two rhesus monkeys reached and grasped 16 objects. The objects varied systematically in volume, shape, and orientation and each was grasped at five different force levels. Linear multiple regression analyses showed the simple spike discharge was significantly modulated in relation to objects and force levels. Object related modulation occurred preferentially during reach or early in the grasp and was linearly related to grasp aperture. The simple spike discharge was positively correlated with grasp force during both the reach and the grasp. There was no significant interaction between object and grasp force modulation, supporting previous kinematic findings that grasp kinematics and force are signaled independently. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was used to quantify the temporal patterns in the simple spike discharge. Most cells had a predominant discharge pattern that remained relatively constant across object grasp dimensions and force levels. A single predominant simple spike discharge pattern that spans reach and grasp and accounts for most of the variation (>60\%) is consistent with the concept that the cerebellum is involved with synergies underlying prehension. Therefore Purkinje cells are involved with the signaling of prehension, providing independent signals for hand shaping and grasp force.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although children with cerebral palsy display large developmental differences in hand function from that of typically developing children by the age of 6 to 10 years, little is known about the developmental processes underlying hand function during subsequent development. In this study we investigated the development of manual dexterity in a timed motor task, the timing and amplitude of fingertip-force application during a precision grasping task, and the relationship between changes in these measures. We applied highly quantitative analytical approaches to determine if the fingertip-force application pattern and trial-to-trial variation of fingertip-force application change during development. METHODS: Twelve subjects with cerebral palsy (aged 6-8 years) participated in the first data-collection session conducted between 1989 and 1990. Ten of these subjects (5 with hemiplegia and 5 with diplegia, aged 19-21 years) returned between 2002 and 2003. Manual dexterity was measured by using timed tasks of the Jebsen-Taylor test of hand function. Subjects also lifted an object instrumented with force transducers while we measured the temporal coordination of fingertip coordination and the path ratio between the grip and vertical load-force trajectory (straightness). We used generalized procrustes analysis to determine if there were changes in shape of the force trajectory and intertrial variability. RESULTS: The Jebsen-Taylor test times decreased 45\% from the first to the second data session. The overall time to complete the grip-lift task decreased 22\%, mainly because of a faster transition from grasp to lift. The grip-force/load-force path ratios decreased from 1.7 to 1.35 (1 = straight line). Generalized procrustes analysis indicated a change in the shape and a decrease in variability in shape of the force-ratio path. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the efficiency in grasping had developed during a 13-year period for this small group of participants with cerebral palsy, which suggests that improvement in hand function occurs over a longer time frame than commonly would be expected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier reports on reduced physical performance and osteoporosis-related fractures have mostly been short-term studies. The aim of this investigation was to examine the effects of fractures on physical functioning 3 years after trauma, the latter being stratified for pain. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of a population-based case-control study including 289 subjects from the "Good Ageing in Sk\aa ne" project. Men and women with fractures, aged 60-93 years, were divided into one group with pain (FP, n = 71) and one without pain (FnP, n = 53). Fractures included vertebrae, hip, pelvis or ankle according to the national medical register. A third group of subjects without fractures or pain (CnP, n = 165) was used as control. Pain during the previous month, health variables, lifestyle, medication, use of a walking aid, and sociodemographic variables were self-reported. Walking 15 m, 2 x 15 m, and timed get-up-and-go (TUG)--all at self-selected and maximum speed--and maximum handgrip strength were assessed objectively. RESULTS: Among the FP patients, almost half of the group suffered pain on a daily basis. The subjects in the CnP and FnP groups performed significantly better than the FP patient group in all functional tests. Median time for walking a distance of 15 m at self-selected speed was 16, 13 and 12 sec for the CnP, FnP and FP groups, respectively. Both fracture and pain independently explained lower walking speed (self-selected and maximum) as well as TUG, adjusted for age, sex and co-morbidity in a multiple regression model. Those who had sustained fractures more than 3 years previously performed significantly better in walking 15 m and 2 x 15 m at both self-elected and maximum speed than those with a more recent fracture, irrespective of pain. INTERPRETATION: After 3 years, patients who had sustained a fracture but who experienced no pain performed almost as well as control subjects. Pain and fracture were independently influenced by physical function.},

abstract = {Rescue activities frequently require not only substantial and sustained hand-grip forces but also a subtle coordination of hand and finger muscles, e.g. when manipulating injection syringes after manual stretcher carriage. We investigated the recovery kinetics of manual coordination and muscle strength after exhausting stretcher carriage (4.5 km/h, load at each handle bar: 25 kg). Hand steadiness (frequency and duration of wall contacts when holding a metal pin into a small bore) and parameters of hand-grip strength were determined in 15 male volunteers before and immediately after the stretcher carriage. Measurements were repeated after 0.5, 1, 4 and 24 h of recovery. Mean carrying time was 215+/-87 s (SD), mean transport distance amounted to 264+/-104 m. During the carriage test, forces at the stretcher handles oscillated in the order of +/-50 N within each gait cycle. Immediately after exhaustion, hand steadiness was significantly deteriorated (threefold increase in frequency and duration of wall contacts), maximum and mean hand-grip force over 15 s were reduced by almost 20\%. While the recovery of hand steadiness was complete by minute 30 after stretcher carriage, a significant reduction in maximum and mean hand-grip force by 12\% could still be observed after 24 h. The present findings demonstrate that hand steadiness recovers much faster than maximum hand-grip strength after exhaustive manual stretcher carriage (less than 30 min vs. more than 24 h). Probably, muscle damage induced in particular by the eccentric components during stretcher transport seems to affect only the generation of large forces. By contrast, the generation and coordination of the much lower forces required for hand-steadiness appears to be impaired only during the short transient of metabolic recovery.},

abstract = {Present evidence suggests that modern humans were the first hominid species to successfully colonize high-latitude environments (> or =55 degrees N). Given evidence for a recent (<200,000 years) lower latitude naissance of modern humans, the global dispersal and successful settlement of arctic and subarctic regions represent an unprecedented adaptive shift. This adaptive shift, which included cultural, behavioral, and biological dimensions, allowed human populations to cope with the myriad environmental stressors encountered in circumpolar regions. Although unique morphological and physiological adaptations among contemporary northern residents have been recognized for decades, human biologists are only now beginning to consider whether biological adaptations to regional environmental conditions influence health changes associated with economic modernization and lifestyle change. Recent studies have documented basal metabolic rates (BMRs) among indigenous Siberian populations that are systematically elevated compared to lower latitude groups; this metabolic elevation apparently is a physiological adaptation to cold stress experienced in the circumpolar environment. Important health implications of metabolic adaptation are suggested by research with the Yakut (Sakha), Evenki, and Buriat of Siberia. BMR is significantly positively correlated with blood pressure, independently of body size, body composition, and various potentially confounding variables (e.g., age and smoking). Further, this research has documented a significant negative association between BMR and LDL cholesterol, which remains after controlling for potential confounders; this suggests that high metabolic turnover among indigenous Siberians has a protective effect with regard to plasma lipid levels. These results underscore the importance of incorporating an evolutionary approach into health research among northern populations.},

Total length (LNG) and total movement area of CG (REC AREA) during the measurements were significantly larger in maximum grip than in rest-stand. In right-handed subjects, LNG increased to 245\% and 250\% of rest-stand value, and REC AREA increased to 589\% and 633\% in right and left hand grip, respectively. In left-handed subjects, LNG increased to 186\% and 188\% of rest-stand value, and REC AREA increased to 400\% and 533\% in right and left hand grip, respectively. No significant difference of LNG and REC AREA was observed between right and left hand grip in either hand dominant subject Maximum grip did not affect CG in rest-stand. In aged subjects, maximum grip power was significantly less than in young subjects (48\%). LNG and REC AREA in rest-stand were significantly larger in aged subjects than in young subjects (220\% and 400\%, respectively). They were not different during maximum grip with either hand. While aged subjects have difficulty of controlling CG in rest-stand, they have less problems to stabilize CG during maximum grip.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In certain occupations, including farm work, workers are exposed to hazardous substances, some of which are known to be toxic to the nervous system and may adversely affect muscle strength. Measurement of hand-grip strength may be useful for detecting neurotoxic exposure. METHODS: The authors studied 3522 participants of the Honolulu Heart Program and the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study to determine whether occupational exposures to pesticides, solvents, and metals assessed at exam I (1965-68) are associated with hand-grip strength at exam IV (1991-93) and change in hand-grip strength over 25 years. Correlation, analysis of variance and covariance, and linear regression were used to evaluate the associations. RESULTS: At exam IV, participants ranged in age from 71-93 years; mean hand-grip strength was 39.6 kg at exam I and 30.3 kg at exam IV. Over 25 years, the decline in hand-grip strength was an average of 8-9 kg for all exposures. Hand-grip strength was inversely associated with age and glucose but directly associated with cognitive function, BMI, and haemoglobin level. No other exposures were associated with hand-grip strength. CONCLUSION: This study did not provide evidence that occupational exposure to pesticides, solvents, and metals adversely affected hand-grip strength in this population, but confirmed other important associations with hand-grip strength.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between grip strength change and bone health according to menopausal status. A random sample of 971 pre- to postmenopausal women from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) study cohort was measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) and grip strength with pneumatic squeeze dynamometer at baseline (1989-1991), 5 years (1994-1997), and 10 years (1999-2001). Fractures were recorded based on self-reports and validated from medical records. Women were divided into two groups according to change in grip strength quartile from baseline to 5-year follow-up: not improved (n = 735) and improved (n = 236). In the total population, the greatest bone loss was observed in perimenopausal (beginning of menopause during follow-up, n = 311) women [P < 0.001 vs. premenopausal women (n = 139)], and it declined in postmenopausal (n = 521) women [P < 0.001 by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)]. The perimenopausal bone loss rate was significantly lower in women in the improved group in comparison to the not improved group (P < 0.01) in contrast to the pre- and postmenopausal groups (P > 0.05). Accordingly, there was a greater decline in perimenopausal LS and FN T-scores in the improved group vs. the not improved group over the first 5-year follow-up interval (P < 0.05 by ANCOVA) and remained unchanged over the 10-year follow-up. In perimenopausal women, there was a trend toward higher fracture-free survival rate in the improved group (82\%) vs. the not improved group (88\%) after 10 years. Adjustments did not change the results. In conclusion, maintenance of grip strength is associated with menopausal bone loss and future fractures.},

abstract = {Understanding how the loss of digital sensibility affects manual dexterity could have important implications for rehabilitation after hand injury. We investigated precision grip function during lifting tasks in seven patients after hand replantation, in five after single digital nerve injury and in four volunteers subjected to digital anaesthesia. Using their affected hand, all participants could successfully lift test objects with parallel and vertical grip surfaces and they all reliably increased the grip force with increasing object weight (0.11-0.55 kg). However, the grip forces used were frequently significantly higher than those applied by the unaffected hand. This was partly due to participants compensating for loss of sensibility with high grip force safety margins against slips, and partly related to misalignments of the fingertips on the grasp surfaces. The latter was most prominent after hand replantation. In a second series of lifting experiments we changed the shape of the grip surfaces in order to investigate the participants' ability to adapt grip forces based on tactile recognition of object shape. An important finding from this series was that in patients with poor clinical outcomes, the contralateral unaffected hand tended to mirror the abnormal grasp patterns of the injured hand. This suggests that control strategies developed for the impaired hand can influence the control of the contralateral uninjured hand. © 2006 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.},

abstract = {In this paper a neural network model for spatio-temporal coordination of hand gesture during prehension is proposed. The model includes a simplified control strategy for whole hand shaping during grasping tasks, that provides a realistic coordination among fingers. This strategy uses the increasing evidence that supports the view of a synergistic control of whole fingers during prehension. In this control scheme, only two parameters are needed to define the evolution of hand shape during the task performance. The proposal involves the design and development of a Library of Hand Gestures consisting of motor primitives for finger pre-shaping of an anthropomorphic dextrous hand. Through computer simulations, we show how neural dynamics of the model leads to simulated grasping movements with human-like kinematic features. The model can provide clear-cut predictions for experimental evaluation at both the behavioural and neural levels as well as a neural control system for a dextrous robotic hand. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: This study assessed the utility and construct validity of a new patient global assessment of symptom change for hand osteoarthritis (OA) by examining its associations with change over time in grip strength, pinch strength, and AUStralian CANadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN). Methods: Participants (N = 531, 80\% female, mean age = 68) were part of a study on the Genetics of Generalized Osteoarthritis (GOGO) and completed two assessments (average 4 years apart). At the second assessment, participants described change in their right and left hand pain, aching, and stiffness on a 15-point scale with descriptors ranging from "Great deal worse" to "Great deal better". Linear regression models examined associations of global change scores with changes in hand strength and AUSCAN, controlling for age, gender, number of hand joints with OA, and time between assessments. Results: Both right and left hand global assessment of change scores were significantly associated with change in AUSCAN, grip strength, and right hand pinch strength (P < 0.05), and approached significance for left hand pinch strength (P = 0.06). The strongest associations were between global change scores and AUSCAN change (right hand: $\beta$ = 0.29, P < 0.001; left hand: $\beta$ = 0.27, P < 0.001). Associations of change scores with grip and pinch strength were stronger among participants with greater radiographic OA severity at baseline. Conclusion: Results support the validity of this new global assessment of symptom change. This measure is particularly useful for assessing change over time when no baseline data are available. Additional research should examine this measure's responsiveness in the context of clinical trials. © 2006 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.},

Age was negatively correlated with vBMD, cortical area (Ct.Ar) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) as well as SSIp in both sexes, and the correlation coefficients were higher in female, compared with those in male. Although age was correlated with endocortical circumferences (En.Le) in both sexes, periosteal circumferences (Ex.Le) were correlated with age only in male. Volumetric BMD, Ct.Ar, Ct.Th and SSIp were significantly lower in the group with vertebral fractures, although En.Le and Ex.Le were similar between subjects with and without vertebral fractures. Grip strength was positively correlated with vBMD, Ct.Ar, Ct.Th as well as SSIp. The extent of correlation was much higher in female, compared with that in male. Ct.vBMD, Ct.Ar, Ct.Th and SSIp, but not trabecular vBMD, were significantly lower in the group with high Brinkman index (number of cigarettes smoked per day) x (duration of smoking (years)) in female.

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to explore the differences in coordination of grip (G) and load forces (L) in a unidirectional and bidirectional bimanual static force production task. Subjects (N = 10) exerted oscillatory isometric L profiles against an externally fixed hand-held device, modulated either in pure tension (unidirectional) or in alternating tension and compression (bidirectional) at a rate of either 1.33 or 2.67 Hz. The unidirectional task revealed a high level of coordination of both the ipsilateral (i.e., G and L of each hand) and contralateral pairs of forces (two Gs and two Ls) as assessed by correlation and stability of force ratios. The bidirectional task demonstrated a low level of inconsistently modulated Gs with respect to the change of L, which resulted in a deteriorated coordination, particularly between the ipsilateral forces. The overall effect of task on the force coordination was higher than the effect of frequency suggesting that the higher frequency of G modulation required in the bidirectional task is not likely to be the main cause of the observed phenomenon. We interpret these differences by a relative simplicity of the control mechanisms of the unidirectional task based on a single synergy of G and L muscles that allows simultaneous coordination of both the ipsilateral and contralateral forces. Due to the switching between two distinctive synergies involving G muscles, the bidirectional task could possess a higher control complexity causing a decoupled coordination of the ipsilateral forces, while retaining the coordination of contralateral forces at a relatively high level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here we offer a quantitative model of the temporal coupling between grip aperture and wrist velocity which shows experimentally that the correlation between grip aperture and object size is a sigmoidal function of movement duration. When wrist velocity reaches its peak value, the correlation between the grip aperture and the size of the goal object has reached half of the correlation that is achieved by the end of the movement.},

In experiment 2, we assessed validity of hand use in relation to grip preference in 2 colonies of chimpanzees via the same methodology. Differences in hand preferences between colonies were associated with variation in the observed grip preferences. There was no evidence of rearing effects on handedness in either colony.

abstract = {Background \& aims: The optimal testing position for hand grip strength, which is a useful functional measure of nutritional status, is open to debate. We therefore examined the systematic difference between different postures in order to establish a methodology that is clinically relevant, easy to perform and reproducible. Methods: Grip strength was measured in the dominant and non-dominant hands with a strain gauge dynamometer in three positions: lying at 30?? in bed with elbows supported, seated in an armchair with elbows supported and in a chair with elbows unsupported. The average of three readings made in each position, each 1 min apart, was recorded. Results: 55 normally nourished subjects (26 male) were studied. Mean (95\% CI) grip strengths measured in the dominant hand with the subject in bed, sitting in an armchair and sitting in a chair were 45.7 (42.3-49.2), 46.3 (42.9-49.8) and 48.5 (45.4-51.7) kg, respectively for males. Corresponding values for females were 29.4 (27.0-31.8), 29.3 (26.8-31.9) and 31.6 (28.8-34.3) kg. There was no significant difference (Student t-paired test) between measurements made in bed and on an armchair (P = 0.49, but the measurements made in a chair were significantly higher than those made in bed (P = 0.001) and in an armchair (P = 0.004). No statistical difference was present, comparing the three separate measurements in each position (Student t-paired test). Conclusions: Measurement of grip strength using hand dynamometry is reproducible and consistent. As all patients are not able to sit in a chair with elbows unsupported, in clinical practice it is more practicable to perform hand dynamometry with the elbows supported in a bed or armchair. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known about how specific radiographic features are related to hand strength in osteoarthritis (OA). This study examined associations of radiographic variables with pinch and grip strength among individuals with radiographic hand OA. METHODS: Participants (n = 700, 80\% female, mean age 69 years) were part of a study on the genetics of generalized OA. All had bilateral radiographic hand OA. Linear models were used to examine associations of grip and pinch strength with 1) OA in joint groups (proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal [MCP], carpometacarpal [CMC]), 2) OA in rays (first through fifth), and 3) summed Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grades for severity of OA in all joints. Adjusted models controlled for age, sex, hand pain, chondrocalcinosis, and hand hypermobility. Mixed models accounted for clustering within families. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all joint groups, all rays, and total summed K/L grades were significantly negatively associated with grip and pinch strength (P < 0.05). In adjusted models, the only joint group significantly associated with grip strength was the CMCs, and only OA in the MCP joint was significantly associated with pinch strength (P < 0.05). The only ray significantly associated with grip strength (P < 0.05) was ray 1, and no individual rays were significantly associated with pinch strength. A higher summed K/L grade was significantly associated with both lower grip strength and lower pinch strength. CONCLUSION: Among individuals with radiographic hand OA, increasing radiographic severity is associated with reduced grip and pinch strength, even when controlling for self-reported pain. Individuals with radiographic OA in specific locations (CMC joints, MCP joints, and ray 1) may be at particular risk for reduced hand strength.},

abstract = {Understanding grasping control after stroke is important for relearning motor skills. The authors examined 10 individuals (5 males; 5 females; ages 32-86) with chronic unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke (4 right lesions; 6 left lesions) when lifting a novel test object using skilled precision grip with their ipsilesional ("unaffected") hand compared to healthy controls (n = 14; 6 males; 8 females; ages 19-86). All subjects possessed normal range of motion, cutaneous sensation, and proprioception in the hand tested and had no apraxia or cognitive deficits. Subjects lifted the object 10 times at each object weight (260 g, 500 g, 780 g) using a moderately paced self-selected lifting speed. The normal horizontal ("grip") force and vertical tangential ("lift") force were separately measured at the thumb and index finger. Regardless of the object weight or stroke location, the stroke group generated greater grip forces at liftoff of the object (> or =39\%; P < or = 0.05) and across the dynamic (P < or = 0.05) and static portions (P < or = 0.05) of the lifts compared to the healthy group. Peak lift forces were equivalent between groups, suggesting accurate load force information processing occurred. These results warrant further investigation of altered sensorimotor processing or compensatory biomechanical strategies that may lead to inaccurate grip force execution after strokes.},

This study examined the impact of shape of the hand (as relatively long, average, or square shaped) on maximal voluntary isometric grip strength and test-retest reliability in a group of healthy teenagers aged 13 to 17 years. When 116 boys and 112 girls were measured with a GripTrack (a computer-linked Jamar-like isometric hand grip dynamometer; JTech Medical Industries, Salt Lake City, UT), boys were significantly stronger than girls (by 11.02 kg force, p < 0.01), and dominant hands were significantly stronger than nondominant hands (by 2.53 kg force, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences due to hand shape. To examine the reliability of the grip strength test, 74 boys and 75 girls were retested, with a mean retest time interval of 15.5 days. There was a small but significant improvement in grip strength (by 0.62 kg force, p < 0.01). Regarding male subjects, the test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 3,1) for both hands of the three hand-shape groups were excellent, with ICC values ranging from 0.954 to 0.973. For the female subjects, however, reliability values declined across the three hand-shape groups from long to square (ICC 0.920-0.476), such that compared with their male counterparts, strength test reliability examined by the 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) was significantly lower for average and square hand shapes. Although there may be several factors contributing to this difference between boys and girls in strength test reliability for different hand-shape groups, it is possible that Jamar-like handgrip dynamometers have a handle shape that impedes those girls with relatively square hands from giving reliable grip strength readings over time.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between grip strength change and postmenopausal bone loss. The study population, 622 peri- and postmenopausal women, was a random sample of the OSTPRE-study cohort (n=13,100) in Kuopio, Finland. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) was measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry and grip strength with a pneumatic squeeze dynamometer at baseline in 1989-1991, at the 5-year follow-up in 1994-1997 and at the 10-year follow-up in 1999-2001. Women were divided into three groups according to the change in age-grouped grip strength quartile they belonged to in each measurement (n in 5-year/10-year follow-up): "decreased" (n=150/n=140), "maintained" (n=314/n=320) and "improved" (n=158/n=162). Women within the improved group had significantly lower bone loss at both FN and LS in comparison to the other two groups after 10 years of follow-up (P<0.01). Furthermore, in HRT non-users (n=305) the difference between the improved group and maintained group was only modest (P=0.04). In contrast, in HRT users (n=310) the mean annual BMD change among the improved group was positive (bone gain 0.11\%/year) and differed significantly in comparison to modest bone loss in the decreased and maintained groups in both LS and FN (P<0.01). The linear trend between grip strength quartile change and LS/FN bone loss was significant in HRT users (P<0.001) in contrast to HRT non-users (P=NS) in the linear regression model. Any of these differences were not affected by adjustments for age, weight, height and other potential confounders. In conclusion, the present study suggests that improvement in age-grouped grip strength quartile is strongly associated with axial bone loss among postmenopausal women. This effect seemed to interact positively with estrogen repletion status. These results encourage performing further clinical studies on associations between muscle strength changes and bone loss.},

Grip type for simple reaching was assessed for the left and right hand and classified as thumb-index, middle-index, or single-digit responses. Fingerprint patterns were characterized as whorls, loops, or arches on each finger. The results indicated that chimpanzees exhibit significantly more thumb-index responses for the right compared to the left hand. In addition, thumb-index responses were more prevalent for subjects that had a whorl compared to a loop or arch on their thumb. The results suggest that fingerprint patterns are associated with individual differences in grasping type in chimpanzees as well as some variation in hand use.},

abstract = {The effects of growth and pubertal development on the bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and hip in peripubertal Japanese children were studied as a basis for evaluating the effects of modifiable factors on bone mass gain. The study comprised bone mass measurements in the lumbar spine (L2-4), femoral neck, and total hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry as well as body size measurements and detailed interviews on medical history and pubertal status. The subjects were 404 first-grade students in three junior high schools (129 boys and 275 girls, mean age 12.8 +/- 0.3 years) with no diseases or medication that would affect bone metabolism. BMD at each site showed an increasing trend with physical growth and sexual maturity. Significant positive correlations were observed between BMD at every skeletal site and height, weight, and grip strength in pre- and postpubertal boys and girls. In multiple regression analyses, pubertal development had a significant positive independent effect on BMD at every skeletal site in girls, but not in boys. Physical and pubertal development showed major effects on BMD, but the magnitude of these effects differed in boys and girls, even if they were of the same age. We conclude that confounding factors due to physical and pubertal development should be taken into consideration in different ways for boys and girls in investigations on the effects of environmental or behavioral factors on bone mass acquisition in peripubertal children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focal task specific dystonia occurs preferentially during performance of a specific task. There may be an inefficiently high grip force when doing manipulative tasks other than the trigger task, possibly reflecting a generalised impairment of sensory-motor integration. OBJECTIVE: To examine how well subjects with writer's cramp (n = 4) or musician's cramp (n = 5) adapted their grip force when lifting a new object or catching a weight. METHODS: Nine patients with focal hand dystonia and 10 controls were studied. Experiments addressed different motor behaviours: (A) lifting and holding an object; (B) adjusting grip force in anticipation of or in reaction to a change in load force by catching a small weight dropped expectedly or unexpectedly into a hand held receptacle. RESULTS: In (A), patients produced a grip force overshoot during the initial lifts; force overflow was most pronounced in those with writer's cramp. Patients and controls adjusted their grip force to object weight within one or two lifts, though patients settled to a steady force level above normal. In (B), patients with focal hand dystonia and normal controls showed similar predictive grip force adjustments to expected changes in object load, suggesting that this aspect of sensory-motor integration was normal. Patients had a shorter latency of grip force response than controls after an unexpected load increase, reflecting either a greater level of preparatory motor activity or a disinhibited spinal reflex response. CONCLUSIONS: The overall increased grip force in patients with focal hand dystonia is likely to be a prelearned phenomenon rather than a primary disorder of sensory-motor integration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Grip strength has been reported to be associated with bone mass locally at the forearm and also at distant skeletal sites, including the spine and hip. Less is known about the association between low grip strength and risk of vertebral fracture. The aim of this study was to examine the association between low grip strength, bone mineral density at the hip and spine, and vertebral fracture in middle-aged and elderly European men and women. METHODS: Men and women aged 50 yr and over were recruited for participation in a screening survey of vertebral osteoporosis across Europe. Subjects who agreed to take part had an interviewer-administered questionnaire and lateral spinal radiographs performed. Subjects were assessed also for grip strength using a handgrip dynamometer (range 0-300 mmHg). A subsample of those recruited had bone mineral density measurements performed at the spine and femoral neck. Subjects had repeat lateral spine radiographs performed a mean of 3.8 yr following the baseline survey. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between low grip strength and bone mineral density at the hip and spine. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between grip strength and both prevalent and incident vertebral fracture. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and sixty-five men and 1380 women with data concerning grip strength and bone mineral density were included in the analysis. In women, after age adjustment, compared with those with 'normal' grip, those with 'impaired' (231-299 mmHg) and low grip (<231 mmHg) had significantly lower bone mass at the spine and femoral neck. In men, those with low grip strength had a lower BMD at the spine and hip than those in the normal group. However, because of the small numbers with submaximal grip strength, the confidence intervals around all estimates included zero. Adjustment for body size and levels of physical activity had little effect on the results. In addition, among women, after adjustment for age, body mass index and physical activity levels, compared with those with normal grip, those with low grip strength had an increased risk of developing incident vertebral fracture (odds ratio = 2.67; 95\% confidence interval 1.13, 6.30). Further adjustment for spine bone density had little influence on the association (odds ratio = 2.60). CONCLUSIONS: In women, low grip strength is associated with low bone mineral density at both the spine and hip and an increased risk of incident vertebral fracture. These associations cannot be explained by differences in body size or lifestyle.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to evaluate a method for testing bimanual prehension based on a novel experimental device. The device consists of two handles allowing for simultaneous measurement of bimanual hand grip forces (GF) and different patterns of load forces (LF) exerted during compression and tension along the longitudinal axis. In order to assess the reliability of the obtained measures, eight healthy subjects were tested over three consecutive test, while three moderately impaired neurological patients were tested once. In healthy subjects, high coordination was observed between GFs and LFs, as well as between two GFs and two LFs. The results also suggest a satisfactory task performance in regards to exerting the instructed LF profile, as well as a sufficient, but not excessive GF. The reliability of most of the assessed variables proved to be either moderate or high. When compared to healthy subjects, the data obtained from neurological patients mainly revealed irregular patterns of LFs, excessive GFs, as well as a relatively weak relationship between GFs and LFs. It was concluded that the evaluated methodological approach can be applied not only to explore uni- and bi-manual coordination of arm and hand grip forces in various prehensile activities, but also to serve as a basis for future development of specific clinical tests for neurological patients and other populations that demonstrate impaired hand function. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate the function of fibers that connect the hand area of the primary motor and sensory cortices. A 63-year-old male with a metastatic brain tumor located in the left primary motor area underwent awake surgery. During removal of the tumor, the posterior end of the primary motor cortex, including the fibers between the motor and sensory cortex, was resected, as confirmed by 3D reconstruction of fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Preoperative fMRI with right hand clenching revealed activation in the area around the tumor in the primary motor area. Postoperative fMRI with right hand clenching showed posterior shift of the activation to the sensory area. In contrast, 3D reconstruction of fMRI and DTI with left hand clenching showed activation of cortex corresponding to the motor and sensory hand area. Postoperative neurological examination revealed no change in right hand strength, but the patient complained of decrease right hand grasp stability when he concentrated on using his left hand. These findings suggest that the fibers connecting the primary hand motor and sensory areas play a role in the hand grasp stability. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When we repetitively lift an object, our grip force is influenced by the mechanical object properties of the preceding lift, irrespective of whether the subsequent lift is performed with the same hand or the hand opposite to the preceding lift. This study investigates if repetitive high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dominant primary motor cortex affects this relationship. After completion of 10 lifts of an object using the dominant hand, rTMS was applied over the dominant primary motor cortex for 20 s. On the first lift following rTMS, the peak grip force was significantly higher than on the lift preceding rTMS. Moreover, this measure remained elevated throughout the following set of lifts after rTMS. rTMS did not change the peak lift force generated by more proximal arm muscles. The same effect was observed when the lifts following rTMS over the dominant motor cortex were performed with the ipsilateral hand. These effects were not observed when subjects rested both hands on their lap or when a sham stimulation was applied for the same period of time. These preliminary data suggest that rTMS over the sensorimotor cortex disturbs predictive grip force planning.},

The authors performed a longitudinal data analysis on data collected between 1996 and 2001 to determine the effects of menopausal status, age, race, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on 3-year changes in grip and pinch strength. Participants were 563 women from the Chicago, Illinois, site of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. According to adjusted analyses, women who became postmenopausal showed a 1.04-kg decline in grip strength (p = 0.10) and a 0.57-kg decline in pinch strength (p = 0.002) relative to women who remained premenopausal. Women who became early perimenopausal showed a 0.20-kg decline in pinch strength (p = 0.04), whereas women who transitioned to late perimenopause showed a 0.93-kg decline in grip strength (p = 0.07). Effects of menopausal status on grip and pinch strength did not vary by race. A significant HRT-by-race interaction for grip strength was found; African-American HRT users had greater grip strength during the study, whereas Caucasian HRT users did not (p = 0.05). Greater physical activity was the strongest predictor of grip and pinch strength (p < 0.0001). Results indicate that transition through menopause is associated with a decline in grip and pinch strength.},

abstract = {Mice from 8 to 21 inbred strains were tested for sensitivity to ethanol intoxication using a range of doses and three different measures: the screen test, the dowel test and a test of grip strength. Strains differed under nearly all conditions. For the dowel test, two dowel widths were employed, and mice were tested immediately or 30 min after ethanol. For the dowel and screen tests, low doses failed to affect some strains, and the highest doses failed to discriminate among mice, maximally affecting nearly all. For grip strength, a single ethanol dose was used, and mice of all strains were affected. Pharmacokinetic differences among strains were significant, but these could not account for strain differences in intoxication. For doses and test conditions in the middle range, there were only modest correlations among strain means within a test. In addition, genotypic correlations across tests were modest to quite low. These results suggest that different specific versions of a test reflect the influence of different genes, and that genetic influences on different tests were also distinct.},

Results for the dominant and non-dominant hands were compared within and between the groups. In the right-handed subjects, the dominant hand was significantly faster with the VALPAR Component Work Sample-4, showed significantly greater grip strength, and had a significantly higher pressure pain threshold than the non-dominant hand. The corresponding results for the two hands were similar in the left-handed subjects.

abstract = {Objective: When we move hand-held objects that exhibit stable physical properties grip force is regulated in anticipation of movement-induced inertial loads. In contrast, when the object's behaviour is unpredictable, grip force is adjusted in response to sensory feedback with the consequence that grip tends to lag behind load. Previous studies analysed reactive and predictive grip force behaviour by systematically varying the predictability of the physical object properties. Methods: This study examines if anticipatory force control also depends on the predictability of the limb dynamics interfering with external objects. The coupling between grip and load force profiles was comparatively analysed during voluntary and externally guided vertical arm movements with an instrumented hand-held object. Voluntary and externally guided movements were performed with and without visual feedback. Results: During voluntary arm movements grip force was precisely regulated in anticipation of movement-induced inertial load fluctuations with grip force increasing in parallel with load force without an obvious time delay. In contrast, during externally guided movements grip force was regulated in reaction to the imposed load fluctuations. However, the reflex-mediated grip force responses were still flexible to account for the differential loading requirements of movement direction. There was no difference of grip force performance between movements performed with and without visual feedback. Conclusions and significance: The results suggest that predictability of both the external object and the dynamics of the own body is essential to establish an anticipatory mode of grip force regulation. Unpredictability of the own limb dynamics results in a reactive mode of grip force control. Reactive grip force control appears to be both highly automatised and flexible reflecting differential loading requirements of movement direction. ?? 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {We investigated whether automatic control of a hand grasp neuroprosthesis by means of signals from natural sensors in the skin of the index finger can mimic the natural control of grasp force in an important task of daily living, namely eating. We designed a simulated eating task with the same ratio of rest and activity as was found on average in a video analysis of three meals consumed in a social environment. An instrumented fork measured grasp force as well as the force in the long axis and perpendicular to the long axis at the tip of the fork. The simulated eating task was performed by a tetraplegic volunteer using a hand grasp neuroprosthesis both with and without use of feedback from the natural sensors. Further, 10 able-bodied volunteers performed the task with the same (lateral) grasp as the tetraplegic volunteer to obtain measures for improving the control strategy of the hand grasp neuroprosthesis. We have shown that a hand grasp neuroprosthesis incorporating natural sensory feedback can to some extent mimic the natural application of grasp force on a fork during simulated eating. The mean grasp force during active phases was higher than the mean grasp force during inactive phases. The mean grasp force applied during a simulated eating task was reduced by using the system with sensory feedback compared to using the system without sensory feedback. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IPEM.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of impairment types to grip strength in the live-at-home frail elderly. DESIGN: All data in this cross-sectional study were collected in face-to-face interviews in subjects' homes by a nurse or occupational therapist. A total of 832 elders with activity limitations, as determined by the FIM instrument, participated in the study. Subjects were divided into three age groups (60-69, 70-79, and 80+ yrs) and four impairment groups: (1) minimally impaired, (2) visually impaired, (3) motor impaired, and (4) cognitively impaired. The outcome measures included the average (in kilograms) of three grip-strength trials per hand measured with the Jamar dynamometer at the second handle setting. RESULTS: There were significant differences in grip strength scores among all age groups, indicating that grip strength decreased with age. Among impairment groups, the minimally impaired and visually impaired groups had significantly greater grip strength scores than the motor-impaired and the cognitively impaired groups. There were no significant differences between the minimally impaired and visually impaired groups or between the motor-impaired and the cognitively impaired groups. CONCLUSIONS: Age and sex are not the only determining factors of grip strength in the frail elderly. The type of impairment affects grip strength as well. Thus, age-based norms may not be the only basis for interpreting evaluation data and establishing treatment goals with this population.},

This study investigates the effects of learning and experience, measurement system, and the nature of the task on grip force estimate accuracy. The grip forces applied during "pure" power grip tasks and simulated meat cutting tasks conducted in the laboratory, and during meat cutting operations at meat packing plants were measured with an instrumented tool handle. Estimates were recorded using the tool handle and a modified hand dynamometer. The results indicate that estimate accuracy varied greatly from individual to individual. No significant effect of learning on estimate accuracy was observed. The result of the meat cutting simulation and field study suggest that the force distribution at the hand-tool interface can markedly affect estimates. Great care must be taken in the collection of grip force estimates, as well as in the interpretation of the data. Improved understanding of the factors affecting estimates of grip force requirements should aid in the interpretation of functional capacity evaluations, and in the establishment of goals for rehabilitation.},

The commonly suggested use of grip strength measurements with a hand dynamometer is not always easily available and may be affected by the patient's compliance. We propose that pain estimation based on the visual analog scale can be considered for this purpose as well because it addresses the painful degenerative lesion in the common flexor origin, which is the basic pathological process in ME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared 237 different sets of measurements of grip strengths and pain evaluation, according to the visual analog scale, in 79 patients with ME. For the purpose of this comparison, we developed a qualitative grading system based on the statistical data of the grip strength values in the normal population. RESULTS: High dependency between the graded pain evaluation and measured grip strength was found. CONCLUSION: We suggest that evaluation of patients with ME according to the proposed grading method of pain evaluation is as accurate as grip strength measurements.},

Methods: The hand-grip strengths of 476 healthy adult subjects were tested using the electronic (Grippit; AB Detektor, Goteborg, Sweden) and hydraulic (Jamar; Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN) dynamometers. Results: Age- and gender-specific reference ranges for the Jamar and Grippit dynamometers are presented. Bland-Altman analysis of the differences between the results obtained using the 2 instruments revealed a bias (mean difference) of 22 N (Jamar - Grippit) and limits of agreement of -86 to 129 N (mean ?? 2 SD), which indicates that grip measurements may vary by up to 215 N between instruments. Conclusions: The study yielded population reference ranges of peak, average, and final strength over a 10-second grip assessment using an electronic dynamometer. Results from the Grippit and Jamar dynamometers are similar; however, the dynamometers cannot be interchanged.

abstract = {When subjects repetitively lift an object, the grip force they select is influenced by the mechanical object properties of the preceding lift. Similar effects on grip force scaling are observed whether the subsequent lift is performed with the same hand or the hand contralateral to the preceding lift. Here we demonstrate that passive vibration of the hand muscles involved in the generation of grip force in the interval between two blocks of lifting trials interferes with predictive grip force scaling. Following ten trials in which subjects lifted an object with constant mechanical properties with the dominant hand, muscle vibration was given to the first interosseus and adductor pollicis muscles of the dominant hand during a 10-min rest period. Compared with the last lift preceding vibration, peak rates of grip force increase and peak grip forces were scaled too high during the first lift following vibration whether the lift was made with the dominant or non-dominant hand. Subjects scaled grip force accurately to the object properties within three lifts following vibration. If subjects rested for 10 min after the first ten trials and received no vibration, then there was no significant difference in the peak grip force or its rate of increase between the last lift preceding rest and the first lift following it. We suggest that vibration impairs the memory processes responsible for predictive grip force scaling. Our data are consistent with the recent suggestion that these memory processes are neither specific for a certain motor action nor do they reflect internal representations of mechanical object properties.},

Sixty-one participants recruited from a manufacturing facility (29 men and 32 women) grasped instrumented cylinders (2.54, 3.81, 5.08, 6.35, and 7.62 cm diameter) using a maximal voluntary power grip. Two orthogonal force measurements relative to the third metacarpal were resolved into a magnitude and corresponding angle. On average, magnitude increased 34.8 N as handle diameter increased from 2.54 cm to 3.81 cm, and then monotonically declined 103.8 N as the handle diameter increased to 7.62 cm. The average direction monotonically decreased from 59.2 degrees to 37.7 degrees as handle diameter decreased from the largest to the smallest. When the diameter was smallest, the greatest force component, Fx (168.6 N), was in the direction where the fingertips opposed the palm. Conversely, when the diameter was largest, the smallest component, Fx (77.7 N), was in the same direction. These values are averaged for the left and right hand. The angle for the largest diameter increased with increasing hand size. These relationships should be useful for the design of handles that require gripping in specific directions, such as for hand tools and controls. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of handles that require gripping in specific directions, such as for hand tools and controls, that reduce effort, and that prevent fatigue and overexertion.},

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: An outpatient physical therapy clinic, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Science, Iran. PATIENTS: A sample of convenience of 30 patients with unilateral C7 radiculopathy participated in this study. Patients were assigned randomly to a control (N = 15, mean age = 46.93 +/- 5.32) and an experimental group (N = 15, mean age = 47.53 +/- 5.6). INTERVENTIONS: Electrotherapy/exercise treatment for control group and combined cervical traction and electrotherapy/exercise for experimental group. Ten physical therapy sessions, three times a week for each group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Grip strength as an appropriate objective parameter was measured before treatment and after 5 and 10 treatment sessions. RESULTS: Statistical analysis (paired t-test) revealed significant increase in grip strength after 10 treatment sessions in control (p < 0.01) and experimental group (p < 0.01) compared with pretreatment score. In the ANCOVA, controlling for pretest scores, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the after 10 treatment sessions grip score (p = 0.65). However, the change in grip strength after five sessions was significantly greater for the experimental group than for the control group (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The application of cervical traction combined with electrotherapy and exercise produced an immediate improvement in the hand grip function in patients with cervical radiculopathy.},

The carpal tunnel decompression was performed under local infiltration with 1\% lignocaine. Grip strength decreased more in wrist flexion than in wrist extension. No difference was found in thumb pinch strength. The authors conclude that some of the immediate postoperative loss of grip strength in wrist flexion can be attributed to prolapse of flexor tendons out of the carpal tunnel in this position.},

abstract = {The control of prehensile finger forces is an essential feature of all skilled manual performance. The basic aspects of healthy grip force control have been well documented within the past two decades. In healthy subjects, grip force is accurately adjusted to the mechanical object properties such as weight, surface friction, and shape: when we move a hand-held object, grip force is modulated in parallel with movement-induced load fluctuations without an apparent temporal delay. At all phases of the movement, grip force is always slightly higher than the minimum necessary to prevent the object from slipping. The absence of a temporal delay between grip and load force profiles implies that the central nervous system is able to predict load variations precisely before the intended manipulation, and consequently regulates grip force in anticipation. Feedback from the grasping fingertips is used to adjust the force level efficiently to the actual load requirements. Pathologic grip force control affects the efficiency of the forces produced and the predictive temporal coupling between grip and load force profiles. Here we demonstrate pathologic grip force control in various neurologic disorders. The analysis of grip force control is simple and highly sensitive for detecting healthy and pathologic motor behaviour. The examination of grip force control is well suited for an objective evaluation of therapy during sensorimotor rehabilitation of deficient hand function.},

abstract = {Understanding how the CNS controls reach-to-grasp will require behavioral and neurophysiological studies of reach-to-grasp in the monkey, including the evaluation of whole-hand grasp with explicit force requirements. In this study, monkeys performed a reach-to-grasp task in which the size, shape, and orientation of the objects were varied. The monkeys were required to grasp each object at five force levels based on visual feedback. Seventeen positions on the wrist and hand were monitored to quantify kinematics. Hand shaping began with initiation of reach and continued throughout the reach, matching object properties even without vision of the hand or object. Grasp aperture scaled to object size. Singular value decomposition analysis of the marker positions identified two dominant hand postures. The first eigenvector or "eigenposture" consisted of an open hand configuration midway between flexion and extension that explained >93\% of the variance. The second eigenposture consisted of hyperextension of all joints that accounted for another 4-5\% of the variance. The two eigenpostures were similar across force levels and between monkeys. Reach kinematics consisted of a U-shaped hand path with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Trajectory and speed were independent of grasp force and object properties. In summary, hand shaping during the reach occurred without vision of the hand or object, and hand kinematics were not dependent on grasp force. Furthermore, the reach was independent of grasp force and object properties. These observations imply that the kinematics of reach-to-grasp and grasp force are controlled independently. Similar to humans, monkeys may use a simplifying strategy to reduce the degrees of freedom of the hand during reach-to-grasp.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of the first generation of a portable system for a hand grasp neuroprosthesis that is controlled by means of signals from natural sensors in the skin of the index finger. To reduce development time and costs, we based our design on readily available, standardised modules such as a 486DX100 compatible CPU, a data acquisition board, a flash disk storage unit, and a high-efficiency DC/DC switch-mode power supply. Additionally, we designed and built a telemeter to supply an implanted muscle stimulator with power and control data. The signal from the natural sensors was recorded with a cuff electrode implanted around the palmar digital nerve innervating the radial aspect of the index finger. For amplification of the recorded nerve signal, we added an external low-noise nerve signal amplifier. For pre-processing of the recorded nerve signal, an optimised band-pass filter was used. A data-recording unit allowed storage and off-line analysis of the stimulator command and the recorded nerve signal. The portable system was used by a tetraplegic volunteer to test the feasibility of including natural sensors in a hand grasp neuroprosthesis for activities of daily living. The flexibility of the presented system allows rapid prototyping of experimental FES hand grasp systems intended for portable use. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IPEM.},

abstract = {Experiments executed on the upper limb are assuming increasing significance in the frame of the Human Physiology in space, for at least two reasons: the upper limb is the principal means of locomotion for the subject living in a space station; furthermore, fatigue can have a significant effect on the hand, for the ordinary work on board, and in particular for the extra-vehicular activities. The degradation of the performances affecting the muscular-skeletal apparatus can be easily recognized on the upper limb, by exerting specific scientific protocols, to be repeated through the permanence of the subject in weightlessness conditions. Another aspect relevant to the effect of microgravity on the upper limb is associated with the alteration of the motor control programs due to the different gravity factor, affecting not only the bio-mechanics of the subject, but in general all his/her psycho-physical conditions, induced by the totally different environment. Specific protocols on the upper limb can facilitate the studies on learning mechanisms for the motor control. The results of such experiments can be transferred to the Earth, useful for treatment of subjects with local traumas or diseases of the Central Nervous System. ?? 2003 COSPAR.

abstract = {Previous research has shown that grip and load forces are modulated simultaneously during manipulation of a hand-held object. This close temporal coupling suggested that both forces are controlled by an internal model within the CNS that predicts the changes in tangential force on the fingers. The objective of the present study was to examine how the internal model would compensate for the loss of cutaneous sensation through local anesthesia of the index and thumb. Ten healthy adult subjects (5 men and 5 women aged 20-57 yr) were asked to grasp, lift, and hold stationary, a 250 g object for 20 s. Next, the subjects were asked to perform vertical oscillatory movements over a distance of 20 cm at a rate of 1.0 Hz for 30 s. Eleven trials were performed with intact sensation, and 11 trials after a local ring-block anesthesia of the index and thumb with bupivacain (5 mg/ml). During static holding, loss of cutaneous sensation produced a significant increase in the safety margin. However, the grip force declined significantly over the 20-s static hold period. During oscillatory arm movements, grip and load forces were continuously modulated together in a predictive manner as suggested by Flanagan and Wing. Again, the grip force declined over the 30-s movement, and 7/10 subjects dropped the object at least once. With intact sensation, the object was never dropped; but with the fingers anesthetized, it was dropped on 36\% of the trials, and a significant slip occurred on a further 12\%. The mean correlation between the grip and load forces for all subjects deteriorated from 0.71 with intact sensation to 0.48 after digital anesthesia. However, a cross-correlation calculated between the grip and load forces indicated that the phase lag was approximately zero both with and without digital anesthesia. Taken together, the data from the present study suggest that cutaneous afferents are required for setting and maintaining the background level of the grip force in addition to their phasic slip-detection function and their role in adapting the grip force/load force ratio to the friction on initial contact with an object. Finally, at a more theoretical level, they correct and maintain an internal model of the physical properties of hand-held objects.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of osteoarthritis on hand function in postmenopausal women. One hundred patients with hand OA and 70 healthy volunteers as controls were evaluated. Grip and pinch strength measurements and Dreiser's functional index were used for hand function. Pain was assessed by a visual analog scale, and tenderness was assessed by palpation and scored, depending on the severity of tenderness, as 0, 1 or 2. Heberden's and Bouchard's nodules and joint involvement were also recorded. The number of patients with only distal interphalangeal joint involvement was 50 (50\%), those with distal interphalangeal joint plus proximal interphalangeal joint involvement was 49 (49\%), and those with carpometacarpal joint involvement numbered 18 (18\%). The incidence of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodules was 85\% and 36\%, respectively. Eighty-six (86\%) patients were suffering from pain and 57 were found to have tenderness. Grip and pinch strength was significantly lower (p<0.05) and Dreiser's functional index score was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the study group (particularly in grade 4 OA). Grip strength was lower in hand OA patients with distal interphalangeal joint plus proximal interphalangeal joint involvement than in those with only distal interphalangeal joint and carpometacarpal joint involvement. Pinch strength was also lower in patients with distal interphalangeal joint plus proximal interphalangeal joint plus carpometacarpal joint involvement. The patients with Heberden's and Bouchard's nodules had lower grip and pinch strength than controls. Also, pain and tenderness had significant (p<0.05) effects on hand function. Dreiser's total score ranged from 0 to 10 in 80 (80\%) patients and from 11 to 20 in 20 patients. In conclusion, hand osteoarthritis contributes to hand dysfunction, mainly related to the severity of osteoarthritis, pain, joint involvement and the presence of nodules.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the impact of vascular dysregulation on choroidal blood flow response to the hand-grip test and the relevance of this response to glaucoma. METHODS: Eighty healthy volunteers underwent a hand-grip test while choroidal blood flow was measured by means of laser Doppler flowmetry. Blood pressure, heart rate, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were monitored. Choroidal blood flow changes were compared between subjects with a positive history of cold hands and control subjects by means of analysis of variance. The relationship of the vascular response to the level of IOP at which progressive damage occurred was analyzed in 21 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who had progressive damage despite normal or normalized IOP. RESULTS: Blood pressure and heart rate increased and IOP decreased in response to a hand-grip test. Healthy subjects with a positive history of cold hands (n = 36) demonstrated a decrease in choroidal blood flow during the hand-grip test (mean +/- SD: 13.5 +/- 5.8, 12.2 +/- 6.8, and 13.4 +/- 6.9 AU, at baseline, during the test, and 3 minutes after release, respectively), whereas control subjects (n = 44) demonstrated an inverse (12.5 +/- 8.3, 13.7 +/- 9.4, and 11.9 +/- 7.1 AU, respectively) response pattern (P = 0.039). Glaucoma patients with a decrease of at least 10\% in choroidal blood flow during the hand-grip test had lower IOP (14.67 +/- 3.83 and 13.50 +/- 2.59 mm Hg in the right and the left eyes, respectively) compared (P = 0.032) with those without such a decrease (16.54 +/- 3.85 and 16.92 +/- 2.95 mm Hg in the right and the left eyes, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A hand-grip test elicits a different blood flow response in subjects with vasospasm compared with control subjects. Damage by glaucoma in patients with a decrease in choroidal blood flow during a hand-grip test may progress at a relatively lower IOP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is limited documentation of measurement error of grip and pinch force evaluation methods. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine indexes of measurement error for intraexaminer and interexaminer measurements of grip and pinch force in patients with hand injuries and (2) to investigate whether the measurement error differs between measurements of the injured and noninjured hands and between experienced and inexperienced examiners. SUBJECTS: The subjects were a consecutive sample of 33 patients with hand injuries who were seen in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of Erasmus MC-University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands. METHODS: Repeated measurements were taken of grip and pinch force, with a short break of 2 to 3 minutes between sessions. For the grip force in 2 handle positions (distance between handles of 4.6 and 7.2 cm, respectively), tip pinch (with the index finger on top and the thumb below, with the other fingers flexed) and key pinch force (with the thumb on top and the radial side of the index finger below) data were obtained on both hands of the subjects by an experienced examiner and an inexperienced examiner. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard errors of measurement (SEMs), and associated smallest detectable differences (SDDs) were calculated and compared with data from previous studies. RESULTS: The reliability of the measurements was expressed by ICCs between .82 and .97. For grip force measurements (in the second handle position) by the experienced examiner, an SDD of 61 N was found. For tip pinch and key pinch, these values were 12 N and 11 N, respectively. For measurements by the inexperienced examiner, SDDs of 56 N for grip force and 13 N and 18 N for tip pinch and key pinch were found. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Based on the SEMs and SDDs, in individual patients only relatively large differences in grip and pinch force measurements can be adequately detected between consecutive measurements. Measurement error did not differ between injured and noninjured hands or between experienced and inexperienced examiners. Criteria for judging whether the measurement error does allow application of the measurements in individual patients are discussed.},

abstract = {During reaching to grasp objects with different shapes hand posture is molded gradually to the object's contours. The present study examined the extent to which the temporal evolution of hand posture depends on continuous visual feedback. We asked subjects to reach and grasp objects with different shapes under five vision conditions (VCs). Subjects wore liquid crystal spectacles that occluded vision at four different latencies from onset of the reach. As a control, full-vision trials (VC5) were interspersed among the blocked vision trials. Object shapes and all VCs were presented to the subjects in random order. Hand posture was measured by 15 sensors embedded in a glove. Linear regression analysis, discriminant analysis, and information theory were used to assess the effect of removing vision on the temporal evolution of hand shape. We found that reach duration increased when vision was occluded early in the reach. This was caused primarily by a slower approach of the hand toward the object near the end of the reach. However, vision condition did not have a significant effect on the covariation patterns of joint rotations, indicating that the gradual evolution of hand posture occurs in a similar fashion regardless of vision. Discriminant analysis further supported this interpretation, as the extent to which hand posture resembled object shape and the rate at which hand posture discrimination occurred throughout the movement were similar across vision conditions. These results extend previous observations on memory-guided reaches by showing that continuous visual feedback of the hand and/or object is not necessary to allow the hand to gradually conform to object contours.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: chronological age is widely used as a marker of frailty in clinical practice. However there can be wide variation in frailty between individuals of a similar age. Grip strength is a powerful predictor of disability, morbidity and mortality which has been used in a number of frailty scores but not as a single marker of frailty. OBJECTIVE: to investigate the potential of grip strength as a single marker of frailty in older people of similar chronological age. DESIGN: cross-sectional study with prospective collection of mortality data. SETTING: North Hertfordshire, UK. SUBJECTS: 717 men and women, aged 64-74, born and still living in North Hertfordshire, who took part in a previous study to investigate the relationship between size at birth and ageing processes in later life. METHODS: the number of significant associations between grip strength and the ageing markers was compared with numbers between chronological age and the ageing markers. RESULTS: in men, lower grip strength correlated significantly with ten ageing markers compared to chronological age which was significantly associated with seven. In women, there were six significant relationships for grip compared to three for age. The greater number of relationships between grip strength and ageing markers was not explained by the association between grip strength and age, and remained after adjustment for adult size. CONCLUSIONS: grip strength was associated with more markers of frailty than chronological age within the narrow age range studied. Grip strength may prove a more useful single marker of frailty for older people of similar age than chronological age alone. Its validity in a clinical setting needs to be tested.},

abstract = {Previous work has described human reflexive grasp patterns in early infancy and visually guided reaching and grasping in late infancy. There has been no examination of hand movements in the intervening period. This was the purpose of the present study. We video recorded the spontaneous hand and digit movements made by alert infants over their first 5 months of age. Over this period, spontaneous hand and digit movements developed from fists to almost continuous, vacuous movements and then to self-directed grasping movements. Amongst the many hand and digit movements observed, four grasping patterns emerged during this period: fists, pre-precision grips associated with numerous digit postures, precision grips including the pincer grasp, and self-directed grasps. The finding that a wide range of independent digit movements and grasp patterns are displayed spontaneously by infants within their first 5 months of age is discussed in relation to the development of the motor system, including the suggestion that direct connections of the pyramidal tract are functional relatively early in infancy. It is also suggested that hand babbling, consisting of first vacuous and then self-directed movements, is preparatory to targeted reaching. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The five-handle position (five-rung) test is used to determine sincerity of effort of grip strength. However, there is a controversy in the literature concerning its validity and effectiveness. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether test results are affected by the amount of strength exerted by the gripping hand and to determine the test's effectiveness. DESIGN: A total of 30 hand therapy patients performed the five-rung grip test both maximally and submaximally with both the injured and uninjured hands. The standard deviation across the five strength trials was used to measure the shape of the curve. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for each sex. RESULTS: The repeated measures analyses of variance revealed that average strength and the standard deviation were greater for men than for women, for maximal effort than for submaximal effort, and for the injured hand in comparison with the healthy hand. The most optimal standard deviation cutoff value was 8.5 (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.83), and the proportional area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was greater for the men (89\%) than for women (80\%). CONCLUSIONS: The shape of the curve generated by the five-rung test was strength dependent; thus, the test may yield biased results when assessing sincerity of effort in people with weakened hands. The five-rung test was less effective for women than for men. Thus, we recommend that the five-rung test not be used to detect sincerity of effort.},

abstract = {The maximum voluntary muscle force can vary throughout the day; typically being low in the morning and high in the evening. The nature of this possible variation has been investigated with respect to corticospinal excitability. Six healthy subjects were studied. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in the thenar muscles was measured. In addition, we monitored several indices of corticospinal excitability using electromyographic (EMG) recording and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded while relaxed and at 10\% MVC when the silent period was assessed as an index of corticospinal inhibition. Readings were taken every 3 h for 24 h. MVC of the thenar muscles did not change significantly over the 24 h. The mean areas, latencies and durations of MEPs did not show significant changes over the 24-h test period with the muscle relaxed or contracted; however, MEP area did vary between sessions at all stimulus intensities suggesting non-time-of-day-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability. Furthermore, the extent and duration of the silent period seen after the MEP in the contracted muscle did not change significantly over the 24 h of the experiment at any stimulus intensity. These results provide evidence that the MVC force of the thenar muscles and their responses to TMS are stable throughout the course of the day and suggest that, in hand muscles, corticospinal excitability may not be subject to circadian variation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the associations between changes in pain and grip strength and manual tests among patients with chronic tennis elbow. DESIGN: Measurements for 45 consecutive patients with unilateral tennis elbow were made before and after an exercise intervention. SETTING: The setting was a physiatric outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: The patients were 45 persons with chronic unilateral tennis elbow: 32 women and 13 men. The mean age was 44 (31-54) years; mean duration of symptoms was 35 (10-66) weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Manual tests, pressure pain thresholds at three cubital points, a pain questionnaire, a pain drawing, and grip strength measurements were assessed. RESULTS: Grip strength became normal during the treatment. Pressure pain thresholds reached 66\% of that of the healthy arm. Lowered pain thresholds and changes in pain thresholds of the lateral epicondyle were strongly associated with the findings in the manual tests. Mills test and resisted wrist extension tests were associated with perceived pain, and resisted wrist extension tests also were associated with decreased grip strength. Pain on palpation was associated with lowered pain thresholds at the lateral epicondylus and with perceived pain under physical load. After the treatment, for 13 patients all 4 manual tests were still positive; for 17 patients, 3 were still positive; and for 5 patients, all were negative. Positive clinical tests were associated with lowered pain thresholds, decreased grip strength, and high perceived pain scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pain thresholds at the lateral epicondyles are strongly associated with pain on palpation and with a positive Mills test. Resisted wrist extension test results reflect decreased grip strength. Impaired function of the hand is associated with the number of positive clinical tests. Pain threshold evaluation is a simple, easy, inexpensive method that provides useful additional quantitative data on pain and disability among patients with chronic tennis elbow.},

abstract = {Physical functioning late in life has been shown to be affected by genetic factors. Only a few genetic variants have been suggested to be associated with physical functioning, and this only in selected populations (e.g., young healthy males and elite athletes). Declining physical functioning late in life is a major problem in terms of prevalence, morbidity, functional limitations, and quality of life. It is therefore of interest to find a phenotype reflecting physical functioning which has a relatively high heritability and which can be measured in large samples. Hand grip strength is known to be associated with muscular functioning in other muscle groups and with activities of daily living (ADL) functioning, and it predicts incident disability. We studied 1,757 Danish twin pairs aged 45-96 years, and found that this phenotype has a heritability of 52\% (95\% confidence interval (CI), 48-55\%). A powerful design to detect genes associated with a phenotype is obtained using the extreme discordant and concordant sib pairs, of whom 28 and 77 dizygotic twin pairs, respectively, were found in this study. Hence grip strength is a suitable phenotype for identifying genetic variants of importance to mid- and late-life physical functioning.},

Our null hypotheses included (1) no optimal grip span exists for measuring grip strength and (2) optimal grip span is unrelated to hand size. We also intended to derive a simple mathematical algorithm to adapt grip span to hand size. Seventy healthy subjects (40 women/30 men; mean age, 40 years; range; 20-80 years) free of upper-limb lesions were evaluated. Each hand was randomly tested on 10 occasions using 5 different grip spans. Our findings showed that (1) optimal grip span was identified for both genders and (2) hand size and optimal grip span correlated in women but not in men. When measuring handgrip strength in women, hand size must be taken into consideration. We provide a mathematical equation (y = x/5 + 1.5 cm) to adapt optimal grip span (y) to hand size (x) in women. In adult men, optimal grip span can be set at a fixed value (5.5 cm). Copyright © 2002 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of anxiety without depression on functional motor asymmetry in adult men. Thus, left-and right-hand grip strength, fatigue across trials, and motor perseveration was examined among 60 right-handed men, half of whom had been classified as anxious without depression (HI, n = 30) and the other half as nonanxious without depression (LO, n = 30). BACKGROUND: There is substantial empirical support for the notion that individuals with negative affect experience relative right anterior activity. Moreover, previous studies using other groups of interest (e.g., depression and hostility) have found evidence of functional motor asymmetry that is supportive of relative right anterior activation during negative affect. Less is known about functional motor asymmetry among individuals that report anxiety without depression. METHOD: To obtain indices of perseveration, strength, and fatigue, HI and LO anxious subjects were asked to successively squeeze a hand dynamometer. Dependent measures (in kg) were derived from performance with the left and right hands across trials. RESULTS: In contrast to LO anxious subjects, HI anxious subjects did not demonstrate right-hand superiority for grip-strength. Moreover, significant positive correlations existed between grip strength and trait anxiety scores for LO anxious subjects, but not for HI anxious subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The data are partially supportive of differences in functional motor asymmetry between HI and LO anxious individuals. The findings are interpreted as supportive of relative right anterior activity (and possibly decreased left anterior activity) among individuals that report elevated levels of anxiety. Implications for relative right-hemisphere activity and decreased left anterior activity are discussed, and alternative explanations are introduced.},

abstract = {Magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) is involved in controlling goal-directed limb movements such as reaching to grasp. We tested two hypotheses related to RNm's role in controlling reach-to-grasp movements. One hypothesis is that forelimb RNm neurons are grasp specific, and the other is that they specify the timing of metacarpi-phalangeal (MCP) extension to preshape the hand during the appropriate phase of the reach. We recorded single-unit discharge while monkeys performed two behavioral tasks that elicited similar reaches but differed in grasp. One task consisted of a reach with a precision grasp that elicited independent use of thumb and forefinger; the other included a whole-hand grasp that elicited concerted use of the four fingers. Most RNm neurons tested were engaged strongly during both the whole-hand and precision tasks, and the magnitude of discharge modulation did not differ between tasks. Thus most RNm neurons are not grasp specific but, instead, may contribute to behavioral features common to the two tasks. Two methods were used to investigate relations between single-unit discharge and kinematic data from the same individual trials of the whole-hand and precision tasks for a subset of forelimb RNm neurons. One method focused on correlations between parameters of RNm discharge and the duration, amplitude, and velocity of rotation of forelimb joints for each of the tasks. The second method compared between-task differences in times of peak neuronal discharge to between-task differences in times of rotations of forelimb joints. Parameters of reach-related RNm discharge were more frequently correlated with parameters of MCP extension than with parameters of rotation of wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. Analyses of temporal relations between discharge and kinematic data during both the whole-hand and precision tasks indicate that discharge was time locked most frequently to MCP extension and, to a lesser extent, elbow extension during both tasks. We conclude that RNm may command muscle synergies that provide a basic preshape of the hand at the appropriate phase of limb transport. In addition, the timing of RNm's contribution to hand preshaping varies with the behavioral requirements of the task.},

Subjects grasped virtual target discs with thumb and index finger. In 25\% of trials, target size or position (single perturbation), or both (double perturbation) were changed 300 ms after target appearance. The experiments were designed such that the kinematic profiles of grasp formation and hand transport had a similar shape, and were analysed by the same algorithm. We found that grasp kinematics were influenced by changes of target position, and transport kinematics by changes of target size; we also found that the kinematics of double-perturbation trials could not be explained as a linear combination of single-perturbation effects. These findings confirm and expand previous evidence against the view that grasp and transport are controlled by fully independent channels. Most importantly, we found that the time of correction onset was not the same for grasp and transport, neither in single- nor in double-perturbation trials. This outcome argues against a holistic (single-channel) model of prehension; instead, our data are consistent with the notion of two mutually coupled channels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Grip strength is a simple measure of skeletal muscle function but a powerful predictor of disability, morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence has shown that prenatal and infant growth influence grip strength in later life; this may reflect genetic influences on muscle size and function, although strong candidate genes have not been identified. IGF II has proliferative effects in adult muscle and is one of the major determinants of fetal growth; polymorphism in the IGF2 gene could therefore link early growth to adult grip strength. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether polymorphism of the IGF2 gene influences adult grip strength and mediates the association between size at birth and grip strength in later life. METHODS: Polymorphism of the ApaI marker in the IGF2 gene was determined for 693 Hertfordshire men and women born between 1920 and 1930 who had taken part in a study linking early growth to ageing. Grip strength was measured using isometric dynamometry. Genotyping assay development was undertaken in Southampton Genetic Epidemiology Laboratories (http://www.sgel.humgen.soton.ac.uk). RESULTS: In univariate analyses, IGF2 genotype and birth weight were both significant predictors of adult grip strength in the men after adjustment for age and current height. Significant associations were not seen in the women. When IGF2 genotype and birth weight in men were studied simultaneously, both contributed significantly to grip strength after adjustment for age and adult height. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that polymorphism of the IGF2 gene and birth weight have independent effects on adult grip strength in men and suggest that IGF2 polymorphism does not explain the association between size at birth and grip in later life. This study provides preliminary evidence for independent genetic and early environmental programming of adult muscle strength.},

abstract = {Background: The change in brachial artery diameter (DBAd) following release of an occluding cuff (BAOcclR) has been used to characterize local endothelial function and coronary risk. We designed a study to determine the CA diameter (CAd) response to exercise (IHG), whether the response is influenced by coronary risk, and compare it with the BAOcclR method. Method and Results: High resolution ultrasound was used to detect the DCAd in response to 120 s of 33\% of maximum and DBAd was measured 60 s following release of an occluding cuff. There was no change in CAd during IHG. At 90 s following release, CAd dilated > 0.1 mm in 95\% of volunteers with average risk (mean 0.42 ± 0.25 mm or 5.97 ± 3.5\%). There was no change or constriction in 62\% of high risk (0.01 ± 0.28 mm, 0.0 ± 3.6\%), and predominantly constriction in CAD subjects (-0.22 ± 0.23 mm, -0.01 ± 3.2\%), P = 0.0001 for trend and 0.01 between groups. The \%DCAd following IHG and \%DBAd following OcclR were highly correlated, r = 0.66, P = 0.0001. The major determinant of response to each stressor was group (\%DBAd R2 = 0.55 and \%DCAd R2 = 0.52). Conclusions: The reactivity of the carotid artery to IHG is highly influenced by coronary risk, and may be an additional modality to characterize pre-clinical CAD and assess treatment strategies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to provide norms for grip strength in children. A total of 530 Swedish 4-16-y-olds was tested with the instrument Grippit. The instrument estimates peak grip strength over a 10s period, and sustained grip strength averaged across the 10s. The increase in grip strength with age was approximately parallel for boys and girls until 10 y of age, after which boys were significantly stronger than girls. Strong correlations existed between grip strength and the anthropometric measures weight, height and, in particular, hand length. Right-handed children were significantly stronger in their dominant hand, while left-handers did not show any strength difference between the hands. It is therefore suggested that when evaluating grip strength in left-handed children both hands should be assumed to be about equally strong, while right-handed children are expected to be up to 10\% stronger with their right hand. Sustained grip strength was consistently about 80-85\% of peak grip strength, with somewhat lower values in younger children. The present normative data for peak grip strength were slightly lower than 1980s' data from the USA and Australia, probably because of divergences in age grouping and in instruments used. CONCLUSION: Norms for grip strength including estimates of variation were provided for children aged 4-16 y. These data will enable therapists and physicians to compare a patient's score with the scores of normally developed children according to age, gender, handedness and body measures.},

The difference between the dominant and nondominant hand grip was not significant, but was constantly stronger in the right hand for right-hand dominant children. There was a high variation in grip forces (from 6.9 kg to 38.4 kg).},

abstract = {Traditionally, leg cycle ergometry is used to assess the power output of the lower limbs. However, it is suspected that the upper body makes a significant, albeit as yet unknown, contribution to the measured power output, and as such, the lean mass of the whole body should be considered during ergometric assessment. To test this idea, indices of mechanical power output were obtained from 11 subjects during high intensity leg cycle ergometry tests (20 second duration; 75 grams per kilogram total body mass) using two protocols: one with a standard handle-bar grip (with grip) and one with supinated wrists (without-grip). Peak mechanical power, mean mechanical power, fatigue index and total mechanical work values were calculated for each subject during each test and the sample mean differences associated with the two protocols were compared using paired Student t-tests. The with-grip protocol yielded significantly greater peak mechanical power output than the without-grip protocol (886+/-124 W and 815+/-151 W, respectively), suggesting a significant upper body contribution to the maximum power output measured for the legs. As a first step towards quantifying the upper body involvement during leg cycle ergometry, surface electromyography of the forearm musculature was measured in a twelfth subject whilst performing each of the test protocols. During the with-grip ergometer tests, the intensity of electrical activity in the forearm musculature was similar, if not greater than, the intensity of electrical activity recorded for the forearm musculature during 100\% maximum voluntary hand grip-dynamometer contractions, suggesting maximum isometric-type forearm muscle contraction during the with-grip leg ergometry tests. These findings suggest that the performance of traditional-style leg cycle ergometry requires a muscular contribution from the whole body. As such, researchers should be mindful of this, both in terms of the allocation of ergometer loads, and in the analysis of blood-borne metabolites.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify a method for measuring hand grip endurance in patients with hand injury as well as in healthy subjects. Twenty hand-injured patients and 60 healthy subjects participated in the study. Each subject performed two sets of maximal repetitive isometric contractions on the Grippit instrument for 180 seconds, with a contraction time of 2.5 seconds and a rest time of 1 second. Reliability data were high for initial grip force and for absolute and relative endurance values at 90 seconds (r range, 0.73 to 0.97, p < 0.001). Relative endurance at 180 seconds, though, showed weaker reproducibility (r = 0.54, p < 0.01). A measuring period of 90 seconds instead of 180 seconds is suggested, because of the results of test-retest reliability. The method allows endurance to be described in relative force values (as a percentage) as well as in absolute force values (Newtons).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the influence of depressed mood on functional motor asymmetry among school-aged boys. Thus, left- and right-hand grip strength as well as fatigue across successive trials was examined among 38 right-handed school-aged boys, half of whom had been classified as depressed (n = 19) and the other half as nondepressed (n = 19). BACKGROUND: There is support in the literature that depressed individuals experience relative right anterior activation, and previous reports of functional motor asymmetries among depressed adults are generally supportive of this notion. To date, however, little is known regarding the neuropsychology of depression as it may pertain to children; in particular, the possibility of functional motor asymmetry within this population has yet to be explored. METHOD: Participants were asked to squeeze a hand dynamometer four times successively with each hand. The order of hand presentation was counterbalanced, and the dependent measure was in kilograms. RESULTS: As hypothesized, depressed boys failed to demonstrate asymmetry for grip strength, although nondepressed boys exhibited right-hand grip strength. In addition, based on trend, right-hand grip strength for depressed boys fatigued more rapidly across successive trials than did right-hand grip strength for nondepressed boys. In contrast, depressed boys maintained left-hand grip strength longer across successive trials than did nondepressed boys. CONCLUSIONS: The data are interpreted as consistent with current neuropsychological theories of emotion, particularly depression, and suggest that the functional motor asymmetries (i.e., failure to demonstrate asymmetric grip strength) observed in depressed adults are also present among depressed children. Implications for increased right hemisphere activation, decreased left hemisphere activation, or a combination of both are discussed.},

abstract = {A comparative study of the eight motor rating scales available in Western countries demonstrated methodological differences in the choice of items and standardization. We have developed a global motor rating scale that includes items which measure postural-motor, locomotor (PML) and eye-hand grip coordination (EHGC), and which allows the assessment of an average of motor function level (MFL), PML and EHGC development. Scores obtained were used to define the acquisition of motor age based on the skills completed. The items were selected on the basis of the average age at which the function developed in two populations of healthy full-term French infants, followed from birth to 4 months (n = 60) and from 4 months to 4 years (n = 63). Recent French developmental standards (mean age and standard deviation) of acquisition allow the identification of neuro-psychomotor deviations from normal motor behaviour. This includes both static and dynamic motor coordination sequences. Inter-examiner correlations (n = 3) for 15 randomly selected children indicated a coefficient of 0.90. The scale revealed a sequence in the organization of learned postural-motor, locomotor and eye-hand gripping skills which can contribute to the understanding of brain areas implicated in this maturation process.},

This paper describes a device for measuring gripping forces and the moments generated by a hand tool. Laboratory characterization indicated that the device had good linearity (r2=0.999) with minimal hysteresis or creep. The working range exceeds 700N for gripping forces, and 28 and 16Nm for the two applied moment axes. The device, configured as a boning knife, was sensitive to differences in grip forces and applied moments in a simulated meat cutting task requiring distinct levels of precision. Significant individual variation in the 'efficiency' of grip force was also observed. The system design is flexible, allowing for additional tool configurations.

abstract = {An emerging viewpoint is that the CNS uses synergies to simplify the control of the hand. Previous work has shown that static hand postures for mimed grasps can be described by a few principal components in which the higher order components explained only a small fraction of the variance yet provided meaningful information. Extending that earlier work, this study addressed whether the entire act of grasp can be described by a small number of postural synergies and whether these synergies are similar for different grasps. Five right-handed adults performed five types of reach-to-grasps including power grasp, power grasp with a lift, precision grasp, and mimed power grasp and mimed precision grasp of 16 different objects. The object shapes were cones, cylinders, and spindles, systematically varied in size to produce a large range of finger joint angle combinations. Three-dimensional reconstructions of 21 positions on the hand and wrist throughout the reach-to-grasp were obtained using a four-camera video system. Singular value decomposition on the temporal sequence of the marker positions was used to identify the common patterns ("eigenpostures") across the 16 objects for each task and their weightings as a function of time. The first eigenposture explained an average of 97.3 +/- 0.89\% (mean +/- SD) of the variance of the hand shape, and the second another 1.9 +/- 0.85\%. The first eigenposture was characterized by an open hand configuration that opens and closes during reach. The second eigenposture contributed to the control of the thumb and long fingers, particularly in the opening of the hand during the reach and the closing in preparation for object grasp. The eigenpostures and their temporal evolutions were similar across subjects and grasps. The higher order eigenpostures, although explaining only small amounts of the variance, contributed to the movements of the fingers and thumb. These findings suggest that much of reach-to-grasp is effected using a base posture with refinements in finger and thumb positions added in time to yield unique hand shapes.},

abstract = {Objective: To describe the associations between hand osteoarthritis (OA), pain and disability in males and females and to further validate the Australian/Canadian OA hand index (AUSCAN LK3.0). Design: Cross-sectional study of 522 subjects from 101 Tasmanian families (males N=174, females N=348). Hand OA was assessed by two observers using the Altman atlas for joint space narrowing and osteophytes at distal interphalangeal and first carpometacarpal joints as well as a score for Heberden's nodes based on hand photography. Hand pain and function were assessed by the AUSCAN LK3.0 and grip strength by dynamometry in both hands on two occasions. Results: The prevalence of hand OA was high in this sample at 44-71\% (depending on site). Pain and dysfunction increased with age while grip strength decreased (all P<0.001). All three measures were markedly worse in women, even after taking the severity of arthritis into account. Hand OA explained 5.7-10\% of the variation in function, grip strength and pain scores, even after adjustment for age and sex. Further adjustment suggested that the osteoarthritic associations with function and grip strength were largely mediated by pain. Severity of disease was more strongly associated with these scores than presence or absence. Lastly, the AUSCAN LK3.0 showed a comparable association to grip strength with structural damage providing further evidence of index validity. Conclusions: Hand OA at these two sites makes substantial contributions to hand function, strength and pain. The associations with function and strength measures appear mediated by pain. Gender differences in all three measures persist after adjustment for variation in age and OA severity indicating that factors apart from radiographic disease are responsible. ?? 2001 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.},

abstract = {What roles are played by the cerebral hemispheres in planning object-oriented reaching and grasping movements? In an attempt to address this question, we compared the abilities of the left and right hemispheres of commissurotomy patient J.W. to imagine hand manipulation (i.e., grasp) or arm transportation (i.e., reach) movements. A graphically rendered manipulandum (dowel) was briefly presented to the left (LVF) or right (RVF) visual fields in a variety of different orientations. In the grasp selection task (experiment 1), J.W. was required to determine which side of a dowel his thumb would be on if he were to engage the stimulus in a power grip using either his dominant (right) or non-dominant hand. In the reach selection task (experiment 3), J.W. judged which end his elbow would be on if he treated the dowel as an armrest for his dominant or non-dominant forearm. No actual movements were allowed in either task. Movements selected in the imagery tasks were compared with those chosen during actual motor control under comparable circumstances. These comparisons revealed a left hemisphere advantage for representing grasping movements involving the right hand, and reaching movements involving the left arm. The right hemisphere, by contrast, displayed moderate accuracy when representing grasping movements with the left hand, but appeared incapable of imagining reaching movements with either arm. The double dissociation between imagery for hand and arm movements in the left cerebral hemispere is consistent with the hypothesis that grasping and reaching components of prehension involve dissociable planning mechanisms.

Twenty-five subjects with lateral epicondylalgia participated. In a one-group pretest - post-test design, we measured (1) pain with active motion, (2) pain-free grip strength and, (3) maximum grip strength before and after a single intervention of MWM. Results of the study indicate that MWM was effective in allowing 92\% of subjects to perform previously painful movements pain-free, and improving grip strength immediately afterwards. Significant differences were found between the grip strength of the affected and unaffected limbs prior to the intervention. Both pain-free grip strength and maximum grip strength of the affected limb increased significantly following the intervention. Pain-free grip strength increased by a greater magnitude than maximum grip strength. It can be concluded that MWM is a promising intervention modality for the treatment of patients with Lateral Epicondylalgia. Pain-free grip strength is a more responsive measure of outcome than maximum grip strength for patients with Lateral Epicondylalgia.

Each force tremor amplitude was decomposed into four frequency bands (1-3, 4-10, 11-20, and 21-50Hz). Surface EMGs were recorded from the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), extensor digitorum (ED), biceps brachii (BB) and lateral head of triceps brachii (TB). The HG and EF forces for the HG and EF and the HG force for the HG and EE declined rapidly, whereas the EE force remained almost constant near to the initial value for the first 40s and then declined. The decrease in EMG amplitude was observed not for the FDS muscle but for the ED muscle. The HG tremor amplitude for each frequency band showed similar decreasing rate, whereas the decreases in EF and EE tremor amplitudes for the lower band (below 10Hz) were slower than those for the higher band (above 11Hz).

Design: Multicenter cohort trial with at least 3 years of follow-up. Function for each participant was compared before and after implantation, and with and without the neuroprosthesis activated. Setting: Tertiary spinal cord injury (SCI) care centers, 8 in the United States, 1 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in Australia. Participants: Fifty-one tetraplegic adults with C5 or C6 SCIs. Intervention: An implanted neuroprosthetic system, in which electric stimulation of the grasping muscles of 1 arm are controlled by using contralateral shoulder movements, and concurrent tendon transfer surgery. Assessed participants' ability to grasp, move, and release standardized objects; degree of assistance required to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), device usage; and user satisfaction. Main Outcome Measures: Pinch force; grasp and release tests; ADL abilities test and ADL assessment test; and user satisfaction survey. Results: Pinch force was significantly greater with the neuroprosthesis in all available 50 participants, and grasp-release abilities were improved in 49. All tested participants (49/49) were more independent in performing ADLs with the neuroprosthesis than they were without it. Home use of the device for regular function and exercise was reported by over 90\% of the participants, and satisfaction with the neuroprosthesis was high. Conclusions: The grasping ability provided by the neuroprosthesis is substantial and lasting.

abstract = {Neurons involved in grasp preparation with hand and mouth were previously recorded in the premotor cortex of monkey. The aim of the present kinematic study was to determine whether a unique planning underlies the act of grasping with hand and mouth in humans as well. In a set of four experiments, healthy subjects reached and grasped with the hand an object of different size while opening the mouth (experiments 1 and 3), or extending the other forearm (experiment 4), or the fingers of the other hand (experiment 5). In a subsequent set of three experiments, subjects grasped an object of different size with the mouth, while opening the fingers of the right hand (experiments 6-8). The initial kinematics of mouth and finger opening, but not of forearm extension, was affected by the size of the grasped object congruently with the size effect on initial grasp kinematics. This effect was due neither to visual presentation of the object, without the successive grasp motor act (experiment 2) nor to synchronism between finger and mouth opening (experiments 3, 7, and 8). In experiment 9 subjects grasped with the right hand an object of different size while pronouncing a syllable printed on the target. Mouth opening and sound production were affected by the grasped object size. The results of the present study are discussed according to the notion that in an action each motor act is prepared before the beginning of the motor sequence. Double grasp preparation can be used for successive motor acts on the same object as, for example, grasping food with the hand and ingesting it after bringing it to the mouth. We speculate that the circuits involved in double grasp preparation might have been the neural substrate where hand motor patterns used as primitive communication signs were transferred to mouth articulation system. This is in accordance with the hypothesis that Broca's area derives phylogenetically from the monkey premotor area where hand movements are controlled.},

Normal participants, performing with maximum effort or feigning hand weakness, and patients recovering from carpal tunnel surgery were asked to grip a Jamar dynamometer alternately with each hand on ten occasions. The results showed that grip strength fatigued by an average of 23\% during the test in the normal participants, 18\% in participants faking weakness, and increased by 2\% in the carpal tunnel decompression patients. An increase in grip strength after the first effort was found in 39\% of normal participants, 52\% of participants faking hand weakness and in 69\% of the carpal tunnel decompression patients. These results suggest that rapid, repeated measurement of grip strength is not a reliable discriminator of true and faked hand weakness.},

Subjects in this study are 152 intact twin pairs (77 monozygotic and 75 dizygotic pairs) from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study assessed repeatedly for hand-grip strength at mean ages of 63 and 73 yr. Structural equation genetic modeling was used to investigate stability and change in the genetic and environmental components of variance of hand-grip strength in late adulthood. Average decline in strength over the 10 yr of follow-up was -1.05+/-6.8 (SD) kg and was highly significant (P = 0.003). The test-retest correlation between baseline and follow-up grip strength was 0.62 (P<0.001). Bivariate genetic modeling found significant genetic and shared environmental stability in hand-grip strength over the 10 yr of follow-up, with genetic and shared environmental influences accounting for 35 and 48\%, respectively, of the test-retest phenotypic correlation. We conclude from these results that stability in hand-grip strength in late adulthood is due primarily to continuity of genetic and familial influences.},

abstract = {In occupational work, continuous repetitive and isometric actions performed with the upper extremity primarily cause local muscle strain and musculoskeletal disorders. They may also have some adverse effects on the cardiorespiratory system, particularly, through the elevation of blood pressure. The aim of the present study was to compare peak cardiorespiratory responses to fatiguing dynamic and isometric hand-grip exercise. The subjects were 21 untrained healthy men aged 24-45 years. The dynamic hand-grip exercise (DHGE) was performed using the left hand-grip muscles at the 57 (SD 4)\% level of each individual's maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) with a frequency of 51 (SD 4) grips x min(-1). The isometric hand-grip exercise (IHGE) was done using the right hand at 46 (SD 3)\% of the MVC. The endurance time, ventilatory gas exchange, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure were measured during both kinds of exercise. The mean endurance times for DHGE and IHGE were different, 170 (SD 62) and 99 (SD 27) s, respectively (P < 0.001). During DHGE the mean peak values of the breathing frequency [20 (SD 6) breaths x min(-1)] and tidal volume [0.89 (SD 0.34) l] differed significantly (P < 0.01) from peak values obtained during IHGE [15 (SD 5) breaths x min(-1) and 1.14 (SD 0.32) l, respectively]. The corresponding peak oxygen consumptions, pulmonary ventilations, HR and systolic blood pressures did not differ, and were 0.51 (SD 0.06) and 0.46 (SD 0.11) l x min(-1), 17.1 (SD 3.0) and 16.7 (SD 4.7) l x min(-1), 103 (SD 18) and 102 (SD 17) beats x min(-1), and 156 (SD 17) and 161 (SD 17) mmHg, respectively. The endurance times of both DHGE and IHGE were short (< 240 s). The results indicate that the peak responses for the ventilatory gas exchange, HR and blood pressure were similar during fatiguing DHGE and IHGE, whereas the breathing patterns differed significantly between the two types of exercise. The present findings emphasize the importance of following ergonomic design principles in occupational settings which aim to reduce the output of force, particularly in tasks requiring isometric and/or one-sided repetitive muscle actions.},

abstract = {The present study aimed to demonstrate that motor representations are used to recognise biological stimuli. In three experiments subjects were required to judge laterality of hands and forearms presented by pictures. The postures of the hands were those assumed when holding a small, medium and large sphere. In experiment 1, the sphere held in hand was presented, whereas in experiment 2 it was absent. In experiment 3, the same images, showing holding-a-sphere hands, as in experiment 1 were presented, but without forearm. In all experiments one finger of each hand could be absent. In experiment 1 recognition time was longer for those hand postures for which the corresponding grasping motor acts required more accuracy. This was confirmed by a control experiment (experiment 4), in which subjects actually grasped the spheres. Absence of fingers did not influence right-left hand recognition. However, the absence of target object in experiment 2, and of forearm in experiment 3 reduced the effects of the type of holding on hand laterality recognition. The results of the present study indicate that grasp representations are used to recognise hand laterality. In particular, the visual description of how hand and object interact in space (the opposition space [M.A. Arbib, Programs, schemas and neural networks for control of hand movement: beyond the RS frameworks, in: M. Jeannerod (Ed.), Attention and Performance XIII: Motor Representation and Control, Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 1990, 111-138; M.A. Arbib, T. Iberall, D. Lyons, Coordinated control programs for movements of the hand, in: A.W. Goodman, I. Darian-Smith (Eds.), Hand function and the neocortex, Springer, Berlin, 1985, pp. 135-170]) and the anchoring of the hand to the agent are the features of the grasp representations used in hand-recognition processes. The data are discussed according to the more general notion that motor representations are automatically extracted in the process of intuiting situations, or people's intentions. These motor representations, which are compared with those of other people, contain concrete information on the actions (the motor program) by which a situation is created and on the aim of the agents executing those actions.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An ability to predict accurately 'normal' grip strength in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients would facilitate a more accurate assessment of the degree of their functional loss. This, in turn, would allow the setting of more meaningful treatment goals aimed at restoring hand function towards normal. This study carefully measures three modalities of hand grip strength and their correlation with multiple simple anthropometric parameters in normal subjects. We aim to determine which of these parameters are best correlated to grip strength, and whether this correlation is strong enough to allow the accurate prediction of what normal grip strength should be in RA patients. METHODS: In 81 normal subjects (67 female), power, pinch and tripod grip strength measurements were made using an MIE digital pinch grip analyser. These strength data were correlated with specific local forearm anthropometric measurements: forearm circumference, forearm length, forearm volume, hand circumference, hand length, hand volume, hand and forearm volume, and various general anthropometric parameters (weight, height and age). These normal subjects had been chosen so as to be age and sex matched with 83 RA patients (67 female) in whom the same strength and anthropometric parameters were assessed and correlated. In patients, the grip strength results were additionally correlated with two markers of disease activity: a modified Ritchie Articular Index local to the hand and forearm (mRAI) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) assessing subjective pain severity. RESULTS: In normal subjects, clear correlations were demonstrated between hand grip strengths and all specific anthropometric variables, the strongest correlation being with forearm and hand volume (r = 0.729 and 0.638 for dominant and non-dominant hands, respectively; P < 0.01 for both). The patients were considerably weaker than normal subjects. Markers of disease activity showed a negative correlation with grip strength. In normal subjects, the dominant hand was significantly stronger than the non-dominant hand, and on average by 8\%, while the opposite was true in patients, who were 20\% weaker on the dominant side. CONCLUSION: Simple anthropometric measurements, and forearm and hand volume in particular, would be useful at baseline for predicting 'normal' hand grip strength in RA patients, both in the clinical setting and in research trials aimed at improving grip strength and hand function.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Poor muscle strength, functional limitations, and disability often coexist, but whether muscle strength during midlife predicts old age functional ability is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hand grip strength measured during midlife predicts old age functional limitations and disability in initially healthy men. DESIGN AND SETTING: A 25-year prospective cohort study, the Honolulu Heart Program, which began in 1965 among Japanese-American men living on Oahu, Hawaii. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 608945- to 68-year-old men who were healthy at baseline and whose maximal hand grip strength was measured from 1965 through 1970. Altogether, 2259 men died over the follow-up period and 3218 survivors participated in the disability assessment in 1991 through 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional limitations including slow customary walking speed (< or =0.4 m/s) and inability to rise from a seated position without using the arms, and multiple self-reported upper extremity, mobility, and self-care disability outcomes. RESULTS: After adjustment for multiple potential confounders, risk of functional limitations and disability 25 years later increased as baseline hand grip strength, divided into tertiles, declined. The odds ratio (OR) of walking speed of 0.4 m/s or slower was 2.87 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.76-4.67) in those in the lowest third and 1.79 (95\% CI, 1.14-2.81) in the middle third of grip strength vs those in the highest third. The risk of self-care disability was more than 2 times greater in the lowest vs the highest grip strength tertile. Adding chronic conditions identified at follow-up to the models predicting disability reduced the ORs related to grip strength only minimally. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy 45- to 68-year-old men, hand grip strength was highly predictive of functional limitations and disability 25 years later. Good muscle strength in midlife may protect people from old age disability by providing a greater safety margin above the threshold of disability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In knees, quadriceps strength may protect against osteoarthritis (OA). Muscle activity is a major determinant of forces at the hand joints, and grip is a common task during which high muscle forces are sustained, especially at the proximal hand joints (metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joints and thumb base). This longitudinal study of radiographic hand OA examined the association between incident OA at different hand joints and maximal grip strength. METHODS: Four hand joint groups were studied: distal interphalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), MCP, and the base of the thumb (carpometacarpal and scaphotrapezial combined). Subjects were members of the Framingham OA Study who had a baseline radiograph in 1967-1969 and a followup radiograph in 1992-1993 (mean followup 24 years) and had no prevalent radiographic OA in any hand joint at baseline. Incident disease was defined as development of OA defined as a modified Kellgren/Lawrence grade of > or =2. Grip strength was measured in kilograms by dynamometer in 1958-1961 and again in 1960-1963, and the 2 measures were averaged and divided into sex-specific tertiles. Joint-based analysis was performed by adjusting for age, physical activity, and occupational category using the lowest grip strength tertile as the referent. RESULTS: Baseline and followup radiographs were obtained from 746 subjects. Of these, 453 subjects with no prevalent OA at baseline were eligible for analysis. In men, higher maximal grip strength was associated with an increased risk of OA in the PIP (highest tertile odds ratio [OR] 2.8 compared with lowest tertile, 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 1.2-6.7), MCP (highest tertile OR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.1-7.4), and thumb base joints (highest tertile OR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.1-7.4). In women, there was increased risk of OA in the MCP joints (highest tertile OR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.1-6.4). CONCLUSION: Men with high maximal grip strength are at increased risk for the development of OA in the PIP, MCP, and thumb base joints, and women, in the MCP joints. No association was found between maximal grip strength and incident OA in the DIP joints of men or women.},

PARTICIPANTS: 140 men aged 71-91 years who reported no disability in performing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activity of daily living (IADLs) and mobility activities at baseline examination and provided information on their functional status at follow-up 4 years later. MEASUREMENTS: Disability was defined as needing help in performing ADLs, IADLs and mobility. Hand-grip strength was evaluated at baseline by a mechanical dynamometer. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounding variables, a lower concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was the only factor predicting disability in men aged 76 years or younger and only reduced hand-grip strength predicted incident disability in men 77 years or older. CONCLUSION: Poor hand strength as measured by hand-grip is a predictor of disability in older people.

The data are from the Honolulu Heart Program, a prospective population-based study established in 1965. Participants at exam 1 were 8,006 men (ages 45-68 yr) who were of Japanese ancestry and living in Hawaii. At follow-up, 3,741 men (age range, 71-96 yr) participated. Those who died before the follow-up showed significantly lower grip-strength values at baseline than did the survivors. The average annualized strength change among the survivors was -1.0\%. Steeper decline (>1.5\%/yr) was associated with older age at baseline, greater weight decrease, and chronic conditions such as stroke, diabetes, arthritis, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The risk factors for having very low hand-grip strength at follow-up, here termed grip-strength disability (</=21 kg, the lowest 10th percentile), were largely same as those for steep strength decline. However, the age-adjusted correlation between baseline and follow-up strength was strong (r = 0.557, P < 0.001); i.e., those who showed greater grip strength at baseline were also likely to do so 27 yr later. Consequently, those in the lowest grip-strength tertile at baseline had about eight times greater risk of grip-strength disability than those in the highest tertile because of their lower reserve of strength. In old age, maintenance of optimal body mass may help prevent steep strength decrease and poor absolute strength.},

abstract = {Dobutamine atropine stress echocardiography (DASE) detects coronary artery disease (CAD) by increasing myocardial oxygen demand causing ischemia. The sensitivity of the test for detection of CAD is reduced in patients with submaximal stress. We hypothesized that increasing cardiac work load by adding isometric exercise would improve the detection of ischemia during DASE. We studied 31 patients, mean age 57 ?? 11 years, with angiographically documented CAD. Patients underwent DASE using incremental dobutamine doses from 5 to 40 ??g/kg/min, followed by atropine if peak heart rate was <85\% of predicted maximal. Hand grip was then performed for 2 minutes at 33\% of maximal voluntary contraction, while dobutamine infusion was maintained at the peak dose. The addition of hand grip during dobutamine stress was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (143 ?? 21 vs 164 ?? 24 mm Hg, p = 0.001) and left ventricular end-systolic circumferential wall stress (72 ?? 30 x 103 dynes/cm2 vs 132 ?? 34 x 103 dynes/cm2, p = 0.004). Wall motion score index increased from 1.0 at rest to 1.15 ?? 0.18 with dobutamine (p = 0.0004 vs rest), and increased further to 1.29 ?? 0.22 with the addition of hand grip (p = 0.004 vs dobutamine). Ischemia was detected in 19 patients (62\%) with dobutamine-atropine stress alone and in 25 (83\%) after the addition of hand grip (p <0.05). The addition of hand grip during DASE is feasible, and improves the detection of myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {Osteoporotic fragility fractures are related to bone density and injury, which are both related to muscle strength. The influence of genetic factors, such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism on bone mineral density (BMD), is documented but still controversial, and is not known for muscle strength. In the present study, we investigated the association between the VDR BsmI polymorphism and BMD (femoral neck [FN], lumbar spine [LS], and proximal forearm [FA]) and muscle strength (quadriceps and grip strength) in 501 healthy women older than 70 years. No association was found between the VDR genotypes and BMD in elderly women. However, in nonobese women (body mass index <30 kg/cm2), the BMD in the FN was 5\% higher in women with the bb BsmI genotype than in women with the BB genotype (p < 0.05). After correction for muscle strength, no association was found. A significant association between the VDR genotypes and quadriceps and grip strength was observed. In nonobese women, a 23\% difference in quadriceps strength (p < 0.01) and 7\% in grip strength (NS) was observed between the bb and BB genotype of the VDR. After correction for confounding factors and BMD, this association was significant for quadriceps and grip strength. These results indicate a major association of an allelic variant at the VDR locus with muscle strength in elderly nonobese women, which could explain a small association between VDR polymorphism with BMD in the femoral neck in nonobese women. No such associations were found in obese women, suggesting that factors related to obesity obscure such an association.},

abstract = {We investigated the issue of whether or not the CNS makes use of an internal model of the motor apparatus in planning and controlling arm movements. In particular, we tested the ability of subjects to predict different hand-held loads by examining grip force adjustments used to stabilize the load in the hand during arm movements. Subjects grasped a manipulandum using a precision grip with the tips of the thumb and index finger on either side. The grip force (normal to the contact surfaces) and the load force (tangential to the surfaces) were measured, along with the trajectory of the hand. The manipulandum was attached to two servo-controlled linear motors used to create inertial and viscous loads as well as a composite load, including inertial, viscous, and elastic components. The form of the hand trajectory was independent of load for some subjects but varied systematically across load conditions in others. Nevertheless, under all load conditions and in all subjects, grip force was modulated in parallel with, and thus anticipated, fluctuations in load force despite the marked variation in the form of the load function. This indicates that the CNS is able to predict the load force and the kinematics of hand movement on which the load depends. We suggest this prediction is based on an internal model of the motor apparatus and external load and is used to determine the grip forces required to stabilize the load.},

abstract = {Objective: This report describes the operation of the Bionic Glove, a new functional electrical stimulation (FES) device designed to improve the function of the paralyzed hand after spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke. Design: Signals from a sensor in the glove detecting voluntary wrist movement are used to control FES of muscles either to produce hand grasp or to open the hand. When the glove is donned, conductive areas on its inside surface automatically make contact with self-adhesive electrodes on the skin. Setting and Patients: This report concerns nine people with SCI who have used the device in their daily lives for up to a year or more. Measurements were made at clinics in Edmonton, Miami, and Chicago as part of a multicenter clinical trial. Outcome Measures and Results: The mean peak force of tenodesis grasp in the nine subjects increased from 2.6N (passive) to 11.3N (glove active). Active force was significantly greater than passive grasp force even when muscles were fatigued after repetitive grasp release cycles. Most manual tasks improved significantly with the use of the glove, as judged by the number of tasks completed in a minute or the subjects' qualitative ratings of task difficulty. Conclusion: The Bionic Glove can provide significant improvement of hand function in people with C6-C7 SCI.},

abstract = {Objective: Global synkineses are defined as nonpurposive associated movements on the involved side of hemiparetic subjects that are triggered during a voluntary movement. The purpose of this study was to characterize the intensity and pattern of upper limb global synkineses in hemiparetic subjects with a static biarticular dynamometer and electromyography during maximal progressive hand grip on the unaffected side. Design: Survey, convenience sample. Settings: University secondary care rehabilitation center. Data Set: Global synkineses (ie, torques and electromyographic activities) in patients with severe (n = 8) and moderate (n = 7) deficits in motor performance, as evaluated by the Fugl-Meyer assessment, were compared with those obtained in a group of healthy subjects (n = 11). Clinically the subjects from the severe deficit group were more spastic and showed less strength at the elbow than the subjects from the moderate deficit group. Results: Results of analyses of variance showed significant increases of shoulder torque in flexion and internal rotation, and elbow torque in flexion, with increasing force exertion during contralateral hand grip in subjects with severe deficits (p < .05). Furthermore, in these subjects increases of electromyographic activity were also observed in biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii muscles with increasing hand grip force levels. In contrast, no significant torques or electromyographic increases were observed in subjects with moderate deficits and in control subjects during contralateral hand grip exertions. Conclusion: These results provide a quantitative assessment of the kinematic and electromyographic patterns of global synkineses and their correlates with clinical observations. Within the limits of the experimental results presented in this study, it is suggested that global synkineses result from contralateral overflow of the voluntary command to hyperexcitable motoneuron pools.},

Under an external supination moment, the distance between the attachments of the trapeziopisiform band increased after CTR. Under external pronation and ulnar abduction moments, the distance between the attachments of the scaphoideohamate band increased after CTR. The CTR resulted in an anatomic attachment loss for the following muscles: the superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis (shortening by approximately 25\%, relative to rest length), the ulnar part of the abductor pollicis brevis (with opposition and adductory functions, approximately 20\%), the opponens pollicis (approximately 20\%), the middle part of the abductor pollicis brevis (approximately 7\%), and the opponens digiti minimi (approximately 10\%). Preoperative and postoperative (2-7 weeks after surgery) measurements of the reaction force of the distal phalanx (under isometric thumb opposition and finger II-IV flexion with extended carpal joint) led to differentiation of three groups: (1) significant strength loss--the patients showed difficulties with grasping, lifting, twisting off lids and caps, screwing, pulling ropes, and pinching; (2) no significant change in force values; and (3) a significant increase in strength (patients who could grip more firmly).},

abstract = {An automated tuning algorithm was developed to reduce the time and skill required to tune a closed-loop hand grasp neuroprosthesis. The time reduction results from simultaneous tuning of four gain parameters controlling the dynamic response of the system, and from automation of the calculation and decision processes. The new tuning method is therefore an automated parallel tuning method, replacing a manual sequential method in which only one parameter at a time was tuned. RMS error between the step input and the grasp output is minimized, with absence of oscillation as a constraint. The difference between the system's RMS ramp tracking errors for the two tuning methods was less than 1\% of the ramp size regardless of the initial values of the parameters, implying that the tuning methods were equivalent. However, the parallel tuning method was faster and required fewer trials than the sequential method. The capability of the closed-loop system to regulate grasp output in the presence of disturbances was compared with the capability without feedback. Patients were instructed to either grasp an object at a certain force level or to match a certain grasp opening. They would then lock their command at a fixed value, and either remain immobile to test time dependence or pronate and supinate their forearm to test postural disturbances. With closed-loop control, the grasp output was better regulated in the presence of disturbances, with an average output variance 60\% lower than without feedback control.},

abstract = {Three tests have been developed to evaluate rapidly and quantitatively the input-output properties and patient control of neuroprosthetic hand grasp. Each test utilizes a visual pursuit tracking task during which the subject controls the grasp force and grasp opening (position) of the hand. The first test characterizes the static input-output properties of the hand grasp, where the input is a slowly changing patient generated command signal and the outputs are grasp force and grasp opening. Nonlinearities and inappropriate slopes have been documented in these relationships, and in some instances the need for system returning has been indicated. For each subject larger grasp forces were produced when grasping larger objects, and for some subjects the shapes of the relationships also varied with object size. The second test quantifies the ability of the subject to control the hand grasp outputs while tracking steps and ramps. Neuroprosthesis users had rms errors two to three times larger when tracking steps versus ramps, and had rms errors four to five times larger than normals when tracking ramps. The third test provides an estimate of the frequency response of the hand grasp system dynamics, from input and output data collected during a random tracking task. Transfer functions were estimated by spectral analysis after removal of the static input-output nonlinearities measured in the first test. The dynamics had low-pass filter characteristics with 3 dB cutoff frequencies from 1.0 to 1.4 Hz. The tests developed in this study provide a rapid evaluation of both the system and the user. They provide information to 1) help interpret subject performance of functional tasks, 2) evaluate the efficacy of system features such as closed-loop control, and 3) screen the neuroprosthesis to indicate the need for retuning.},

abstract = {A fixed-parameter, discrete-time, first-order, feedback control system is described for regulating grasp during electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles of the hand. The stiffness of the grasp (relationship between grasp force and grasp opening) is kept constant by linearly combining force and position feedback signals. Thus, a single continuous command signal can control the size of the grasp opening prior to object acquisition and both grasp force and opening after contact. The controller achieves this change in controlled variables by scaling and summing the force and position feedback signals, rather than by a discrete switch in control strategy. Experimental tests of the control system in quadriplegic subjects show that control can be obtained over conditions ranging from unloaded position regulation to isometric force regulation, as well as in the transition between these conditions. The robustness of the control system was evaluated during force regulation with isometric loads. Step response rise time and overshoot were much more dependent on system gain than on the location of the controller zero. Responses with rise time less than two seconds and overshoot less than 30\% were obtained over a gain range up to ten, indicating good robustness to muscle gain reductions such as might be caused by fatigue.},

Measurements of pain-free grip strength and maximum grip strength for the involved limb and maximum grip strength for the uninvolved limb were taken on two test dates within seven days of each other. We calculated the variation between measurements within a test session and the variation from one session to the next using generalizability coefficients based on the mean of the six measurements. The coefficients for interrepetition, interoccasion, and overall generalizability were .99, .97, and .96, respectively. The clinical implication of these findings is that the overall generalizability can best be enhanced by averaging grip strength measurements recorded from multiple test sessions rather than by increasing the number of repetitions during a single test session.},

The first step involves electrode profiling, which is a method for characterizing the output of an individual electrode/muscle combination. The electrodes are then grouped according to function and a set of rule based procedures is used to synthesize the basic grasp parameters. Results are presented demonstrating the output from lateral and palmar grasps developed by this method. The method has successfully resulted in grasping patterns that can be utilized functionally.

Grip strength was measured as an indicator of muscular strength in the upper limbs. The grip strength of the estrogen users was significantly higher than that of the estrogen abstainers. Grip strength was related to age (r = -0.25, p less than 0.01), and the body habitus parameters of height (r = 0.36, p less than 0.01) and weight (r = 0.18, p less than 0.01). Although estrogen use was univariately correlated with strength (r = 0.16, p less than 0.05), multiple regression analyses revealed that only the height, age and physical activity were independent determinants of grip strength. These data suggest: height is the major determinant of upper body strength in older women; the reduction in physical activity with advancing age may contribute to strength decline, and modest increase in physical activity may retard the loss of strength that accompanies aging; the loss of ovarian estrogen in menopause may be related to the loss of strength in postmenopausal women.},

abstract = {Both isometric exercise and cold stress have been suggested as alternatives to dynamic exercise for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease. A non-imaging nuclear probe was used to measure left ventricular ejection fraction and relative left ventricular volumes continuously during both of these stress tests in 24 normal subjects. There was a significant fall in left ventricular ejection fraction within 15 seconds of subjects starting a two minute isometric hand grip test at 50\% maximal voluntary contraction, with a mean (SE) maximal fall of 10\% (1.8) after 90 seconds. During two minutes immersion of the hand and wrist in iced water left ventricular ejection fraction fell significantly within 30 seconds with a mean maximal fall of 7\% (1.7) after one minute. Nine subjects underwent repeat tests under identical conditions approximately two weeks later. The standard error of the change in ejection fraction on two occasions was 5.4\% at rest, 7.0\% at the peak of isometric exercise, and 4.8\% at peak cold stress. These results indicate that the reproducibility of both of these stress tests is acceptable when they are performed under carefully controlled conditions. The resulting changes in ejection fraction are transient, however, and moreover depend upon the choice of stress protocol. The discrepancies between published reports of such studies in coronary artery disease may be mainly due to methodological differences, and neither test is likely to be of sufficient discriminative ability to distinguish between individuals with obstructive coronary artery disease and normal subjects.},

Range of motion in the distal interphalangeal joint and hand grip strength in the individual patient are of little value for prediction of isolated finger flexion force, however.

abstract = {The hand grip forces at the front and rear handles of a chain saw were measured during work, in 89 professional lumberjacks. The symptoms caused by vibration to the upper limbs were compared with the hand grip force (HGF) during work. To allow better comparison between subjects we used the ratio of hand grip force (HGF) to the maximal voluntary compression force (MVC), HGF/MVC expressed as a percentage. The mean HGF during sawing varied from 5 to 12 N in all subjects. The variation in HGF was greater at the front handle than at the rear handle, during sawing. The lumberjacks who had vibration-induced white fingers (VWF), had a higher HGF/MVC in both hands than the lumberjacks without VWF. Those lumberjacks affected by VWF used over 12\% of their MVC at work. Subjects without HGF/MVC ratio. The lumberjacks with and without numbness in their hands had equal HGF/MVC ratios.},

abstract = {Twenty-five patients with chest pain were studied by left ventriculography and coronary arteriography. Myocardial metabolic studies were done during control state, pacing tachycardia, isometric hand grip at 30 per cent of maximum force, and combined hand grip plus pacing tachycardia. Nine patients had myocardial lactate abnormality (group 1) as evidenced by myocardial lactate production or decreased extraction (less than 10\%). Though tension time index and triple product (left ventricular ejection time times HR times systolic pressure) as determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption were highest during combined hand grip plus pacing tachycardia, myocardial lactate abnormalities were most frequent during pacing tachycardia. The present study indicates that isometric hand grip even if performed during pacing tachycardia is not a sensitive test for detection of myocardial lactate abnormalities. The rising level of arterial lactate during isometric hand grip is the most likely mechanism of positive myocardial arteriovenous lactate difference.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the concurrent validity of the Dexter Evaluation System with Jamar dynamometer attachment (Dexter) compared with the reference-based criterion of the Jamar adjustable hand dynamometer (Jamar) for measurement of maximal hand grip strength among normal subjects. Sixty-two subjects between the ages of 20 and 50 years, who had no history of hand, arm, shoulder, or neck injuries, were tested with the Jamar in the second handle position and, during the same visit, with the Dexter in the identical position. The Jamar was found to be highly reliable (ICC [3,1] = 0.98) and valid (ICC (2,K) = 0.99) for measuring hand grip strength. In this study, the Dexter was shown to be valid when compared to the Jamar dynamometer for measuring hand grip strength.},
